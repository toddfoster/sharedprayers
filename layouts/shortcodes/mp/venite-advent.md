### The Invitatory and Psalter
Officiant:
> Lord, open our lips.

**People:**
> **And our mouth shall proclaim your praise.**

**All:**
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen. Alleluia.**

**All:**
> **Our King and Svaior now draws near: Come let us adore him.**

> **Come, let us sing to the Lord; *
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.**

> **For the Lord is a great God, *
and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *
and the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it, *
and his hands have molded the dry land.**

> **Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!**

> **Our King and Svaior now draws near: Come let us adore him.**
