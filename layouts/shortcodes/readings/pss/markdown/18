_Diligam te, Domine._

> 1	I love you, O LORD my strength, *
> O LORD my stronghold, my crag, and my haven.
> 2	My God, my rock in whom I put my trust, *
> my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my refuge;
> you are worthy of praise.
> 3	I will call upon the LORD, *
> and so shall I be saved from my enemies.
> 4	The breakers of death rolled over me, *
> and the torrents of oblivion made me afraid.
> 5	The cords of hell entangled me, *
> and the snares of death were set for me.
> 6	I called upon the LORD in my distress *
> and cried out to my God for help.
> 7	He heard my voice from his heavenly dwelling; *
> my cry of anguish came to his ears.
> 8	The earth reeled and rocked; *
> the roots of the mountains shook;
> they reeled because of his anger.
> 9	Smoke rose from his nostrils
> and a consuming fire out of his mouth; *
> hot burning coals blazed forth from him.
> 10	He parted the heavens and came down *
> with a storm cloud under his feet.
> 11	He mounted on cherubim and flew; *
> he swooped on the wings of the wind.
> 12	He wrapped darkness about him; *
> he made dark waters and thick clouds his pavilion.
> 13	From the brightness of his presence, through the clouds, *
> burst hailstones and coals of fire.
> 14	The LORD thundered out of heaven; *
> the Most High uttered his voice.
> 15	He loosed his arrows and scattered them; *
> he hurled thunderbolts and routed them.
> 16	The beds of the seas were uncovered,
> and the foundations of the world laid bare, *
> at your battle cry, O LORD,
> at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
> 17	He reached down from on high and grasped me; *
> he drew me out of great waters.
> 18	He delivered me from my strong enemies
> and from those who hated me; *
> for they were too mighty for me.
> 19	They confronted me in the day of my disaster; *
> but the LORD was my support.
> 20	He brought me out into an open place; *
> he rescued me because he delighted in me.

_Et retribuet mihi_

> 21	The LORD rewarded me because of my righteous dealing; *
> because my hands were clean he rewarded me;
> 22	For I have kept the ways of the LORD *
> and have not offended against my God;
> 23	For all his judgments are before my eyes, *
> and his decrees I have not put away from me;
> 24	For I have been blameless with him *
> and have kept myself from iniquity;
> 25	Therefore the LORD rewarded me according to my righteous dealing, *
> because of the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
> 26	With the faithful you show yourself faithful, O God; *
> with the forthright you show yourself forthright.
> 27	With the pure you show yourself pure, *
> but with the crooked you are wily.
> 28	You will save a lowly people, *
> but you will humble the haughty eyes.
> 29	You, O LORD, are my lamp; *
> my God, you make my darkness bright.
> 30	With you I will break down an enclosure; *
> with the help of my God I will scale any wall.
> 31	As for God, his ways are perfect;
> the words of the LORD are tried in the fire; *
> he is a shield to all who trust in him.
> 32	For who is God, but the LORD? *
> who is the Rock, except our God?
> 33	It is God who girds me about with strength *
> and makes my way secure.
> 34	He makes me sure-footed like a deer *
> and lets me stand firm on the heights.
> 35	He trains my hands for battle *
> and my arms for bending even a bow of bronze.
> 36	You have given me your shield of victory; *
> your right hand also sustains me;
> your loving care makes me great.
> 37	You lengthen my stride beneath me, *
> and my ankles do not give way.
> 38	I pursue my enemies and overtake them; *
> I will not turn back till I have destroyed them.
> 39	I strike them down, and they cannot rise; *
> they fall defeated at my feet.
> 40	You have girded me with strength for the battle; *
> you have cast down my adversaries beneath me;
> you have put my enemies to flight.
> 41	I destroy those who hate me;
> they cry out, but there is none to help them; *
> they cry to the LORD, but he does not answer.
> 42	I beat them small like dust before the wind; *
> I trample them like mud in the streets.
> 43	You deliver me from the strife of the peoples; *
> you put me at the head of the nations.
> 44	A people I have not known shall serve me;
> no sooner shall they hear than they shall obey me; *
> strangers will cringe before me.
> 45	The foreign peoples will lose heart; *
> they shall come trembling out of their strongholds.
> 46	The LORD lives!  Blessed is my Rock! *
> Exalted is the God of my salvation!
> 47	He is the God who gave me victory *
> and cast down the peoples beneath me.
> 48	You rescued me from the fury of my enemies;
> you exalted me above those who rose against me; *
> you saved me from my deadly foe.
> 49	Therefore will I extol you among the nations, O LORD, *
> and sing praises to your Name.
> 50	He multiplies the victories of his king; *
> he shows loving-kindness to his anointed,
> to David and his descendants for ever.
