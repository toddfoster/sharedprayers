> for the LORD holds them by the hand.
> 26	I have been young and now I am old, *

> 32	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, *
> and their tongue speaks what is right.
> 33	The law of their God is in their heart, *
> and their footsteps shall not falter.
> 34	The wicked spy on the righteous *
> and seek occasion to kill them.
> 35	The LORD will not abandon them to their hand, *
> nor let them be found guilty when brought to trial.
> 36	Wait upon the LORD and keep his way; *
> he will raise you up to possess the land,
> and when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
> 37	I have seen the wicked in their arrogance, *
> flourishing like a tree in full leaf.
> 38	I went by, and behold, they were not there; *
> I searched for them, but they could not be found.
> 39	Mark those who are honest;
> observe the upright; *
> for there is a future for the peaceable.
> 40	Transgressors shall be destroyed, one and all; *
> the future of the wicked is cut off.
> 41	But the deliverance of the righteous comes from the LORD; *
> he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
> 42	The LORD will help them and rescue them; *
> he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,
> because they seek refuge in him.
