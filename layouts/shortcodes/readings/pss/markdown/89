> 1	Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; *
> from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.

> 3	"I have made a covenant with my chosen one; *
> I have sworn an oath to David my servant:

> and preserve your throne for all generations.'"

> 11	Yours are the heavens; the earth also is yours; *
> you laid the foundations of the world and all that is in it.
> 12	You have made the north and the south; *
> Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your Name.
> 13	You have a mighty arm; *
> strong is your hand and high is your right hand.

> they walk, O LORD, in the light of your presence.
> 16	They rejoice daily in your Name; *
> they are jubilant in your righteousness.
> 17	For you are the glory of their strength, *
> and by your favor our might is exalted.
> 18	Truly, the LORD is our ruler; *
> The Holy One of Israel is our King.

_Tunc locutus es_

> 19	You spoke once in vision and said to your faithful people: *
> "I have set the crown upon a warrior
> and have exalted one chosen out of the people.
> 20	I have found David my servant; *
> with my holy oil have I anointed him.
> 21	My hand will hold him fast *
> and my arm will make him strong.
> 22	No enemy shall deceive him, *
> nor any wicked man bring him down.
> 23	I will crush his foes before him *
> and strike down those who hate him.
> 24	My faithfulness and love shall be with him, *
> and he shall be victorious through my Name.
> 25	I shall make his dominion extend *
> from the Great Sea to the River.
> 26	He will say to me, 'You are my Father, *
> my God, and the rock of my salvation.'
> 27	I will make him my firstborn *
> and higher than the kings of the earth.
> 28	I will keep my love for him for ever, *
> and my covenant will stand firm for him.
> 29	I will establish his line for ever *
> and his throne as the days of heaven."
> 30	"If his children forsake my law *
> and do not walk according to my judgments;
> 31	If they break my statutes *
> and do not keep my commandments;
> 32	I will punish their transgressions with a rod *
> and their iniquities with the lash;
> 33	But I will not take my love from him, *
> nor let my faithfulness prove false.
> 34	I will not break my covenant, *
> nor change what has gone out of my lips.
> 35	Once for all I have sworn by my holiness: *
> 'I will not lie to David.
> 36	His line shall endure for ever *
> and his throne as the sun before me;
> 37	It shall stand fast for evermore like the moon, *
> the abiding witness in the sky.'"
> 38	But you have cast off and rejected your anointed; *
> you have become enraged at him.
> 39	You have broken your covenant with your servant, *
> defiled his crown, and hurled it to the ground.
> 40	You have breached all his walls *
> and laid his strongholds in ruins.
> 41	All who pass by despoil him; *
> he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
> 42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes *
> and made all his enemies rejoice.
> 43	You have turned back the edge of his sword *
> and have not sustained him in battle.
> 44	You have put an end to his splendor *
> and cast his throne to the ground.
> 45	You have cut short the days of his youth *
> and have covered him with shame.
> 46	How long will you hide yourself, O LORD?
> will you hide yourself for ever? *
> how long will your anger burn like fire?
> 47	Remember, LORD, how short life is, *
> how frail you have made all flesh.
> 48	Who can live and not see death? *
> who can save himself from the power of the grave?
> 49	Where, Lord, are your loving-kindnesses of old, *
> which you promised David in your faithfulness?
> 50	Remember, Lord, how your servant is mocked, *
> how I carry in my bosom the taunts of many peoples,
> 51	The taunts your enemies have hurled, O LORD, *
> which they hurled at the heels of your anointed.
> 52	Blessed be the LORD for evermore! *
> Amen, I say, Amen.
