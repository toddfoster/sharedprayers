_Salvum me fac_

> 1	Save me, O God, \*  
> for the waters have risen up to my neck.  
> 2	I am sinking in deep mire, \*  
> and there is no firm ground for my feet.  
> 3	I have come into deep waters, \*  
> and the torrent washes over me.  
> 4	I have grown weary with my crying;  
> my throat is inflamed; \*  
> my eyes have failed from looking for my God.  
> 5	Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;  
> my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. \*  
> Must I then give back what I never stole?  
> 6	O God, you know my foolishness, \*  
> and my faults are not hidden from you.  
> 7	Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me,  
> Lord GOD of hosts; \*  
> let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me,  
> O God of Israel.  
> 8	Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, \*  
> and shame has covered my face.  
> 9	I have become a stranger to my own kindred, \*  
> an alien to my mother's children.  
> 10	Zeal for your house has eaten me up; \*  
> the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.  
> 11	I humbled myself with fasting, \*  
> but that was turned to my reproach.  
> 12	I put on sack-cloth also, \*  
> and became a byword among them.  
> 13	Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, \*  
> and the drunkards make songs about me.  
> 14	But as for me, this is my prayer to you, \*  
> at the time you have set, O LORD:  
> 15	"In your great mercy, O God, \*  
> answer me with your unfailing help.  
> 16	Save me from the mire; do not let me sink; \*  
> let me be rescued from those who hate me  
> and out of the deep waters.  
> 17	Let not the torrent of waters wash over me,  
> neither let the deep swallow me up; \*  
> do not let the Pit shut its mouth upon me.  
> 18	Answer me, O LORD, for your love is kind; \*  
> in your great compassion, turn to me."  
> 19	"Hide not your face from your servant; \*  
> be swift and answer me, for I am in distress.  
> 20	Draw near to me and redeem me; \*  
> because of my enemies deliver me.  
> 21	You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; \*  
> my adversaries are all in your sight."  
> 22	Reproach has broken my heart, and it cannot be healed; \*  
> I looked for sympathy, but there was none,  
> for comforters, but I could find no one.  
> 23	They gave me gall to eat, \*  
> and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to drink.  
> 24	Let the table before them be a trap \*  
> and their sacred feasts a snare.  
> 25	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, \*  
> and give them continual trembling in their loins.  
> 26	Pour out your indignation upon them, \*  
> and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.  
> 27	Let their camp be desolate, \*  
> and let there be none to dwell in their tents.  
> 28	For they persecute him whom you have stricken \*  
> and add to the pain of those whom you have pierced.  
> 29	Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, \*  
> and let them not receive your vindication.  
> 30	Let them be wiped out of the book of the living \*  
> and not be written among the righteous.  
> 31	As for me, I am afflicted and in pain; \*  
> your help, O God, will lift me up on high.  
> 32	I will praise the Name of God in song; \*  
> I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.  
> 33	This will please the LORD more than an offering of oxen, \*  
> more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.  
> 34	The afflicted shall see and be glad; \*  
> you who seek God, your heart shall live.  
> 35	For the LORD listens to the needy, \*  
> and his prisoners he does not despise.  
> 36	Let the heavens and the earth praise him, \*  
> the seas and all that moves in them;  
> 37	For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; \*  
> they shall live there and have it in possession.  
> 38	The children of his servants will inherit it, \*  
> and those who love his Name will dwell therein.
