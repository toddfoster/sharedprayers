Inclina, Domine
1	Bow down your ear, O LORD, and answer me, *
for I am poor and in misery.
2	Keep watch over my life, for I am faithful; *
save your servant who puts his trust in you.
3	Be merciful to me, O LORD, for you are my God; *
I call upon you all the day long.
4	Gladden the soul of your servant, *
for to you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
5	For you, O LORD, are good and forgiving, *
and great is your love toward all who call upon you.
6	Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer, *
and attend to the voice of my supplications.
7	In the time of my trouble I will call upon you, *
for you will answer me.
8	Among the gods there is none like you, O LORD, *
nor anything like your works.
9	All the nations you have made will come and worship you, O LORD, *
and glorify your Name.
10	For you are great;
you do wondrous things; *
and you alone are God.
11	Teach me your way, O LORD,
and I will walk in your truth; *
knit my heart to you that I may fear your Name.
12	I will thank you, O LORD my God, with all my heart, *
and glorify your Name for evermore.
13	For great is your love toward me; *
you have delivered me from the nethermost Pit.
14	The arrogant rise up against me, O God,
and a band of violent men seeks my life; *
they have not set you before their eyes.
15	But you, O LORD, are gracious and full of compassion, *
slow to anger, and full of kindness and truth.
16	Turn to me and have mercy upon me; *
give your strength to your servant;
and save the child of your handmaid.
17	Show me a sign of your favor,
so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; *
because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
