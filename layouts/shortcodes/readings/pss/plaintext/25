Ad te, Domine, levavi
1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;
my God, I put my trust in you; *
let me not be humiliated,
nor let my enemies triumph over me.
2	Let none who look to you be put to shame; *
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.
3	Show me your ways, O LORD, *
and teach me your paths.
4	Lead me in your truth and teach me, *
for you are the God of my salvation;
in you have I trusted all the day long.
5	Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, *
for they are from everlasting.
6	Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; *
remember me according to your love
and for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.
7	Gracious and upright is the LORD; *
therefore he teaches sinners in his way.
8	He guides the humble in doing right *
and teaches his way to the lowly.
9	All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness *
to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
10	For your Name's sake, O LORD, *
forgive my sin, for it is great.
11	Who are they who fear the LORD? *
he will teach them the way that they should choose.
12	They shall dwell in prosperity, *
and their offspring shall inherit the land.
13	The LORD is a friend to those who fear him *
and will show them his covenant.
14	My eyes are ever looking to the LORD, *
for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
15	Turn to me and have pity on me, *
for I am left alone and in misery.
16	The sorrows of my heart have increased; *
bring me out of my troubles.
17	Look upon my adversity and misery *
and forgive me all my sin.
18	Look upon my enemies, for they are many, *
and they bear a violent hatred against me.
19	Protect my life and deliver me; *
let me not be put to shame, for I have trusted in you.
20	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, *
for my hope has been in you.
21	Deliver Israel, O God, *
out of all his troubles.
