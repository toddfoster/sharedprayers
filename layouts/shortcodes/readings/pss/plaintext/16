Conserva me, Domine
1	Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *
I have said to the LORD, "You are my Lord,
my good above all other."
2	All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *
upon those who are noble among the people.
3	But those who run after other gods *
shall have their troubles multiplied.
4	Their libations of blood I will not offer, *
nor take the names of their gods upon my lips.
5	O LORD, you are my portion and my cup; *
it is you who uphold my lot.
6	My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *
indeed, I have a goodly heritage.
7	I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel; *
my heart teaches me, night after night.
8	I have set the LORD always before me; *
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.
9	My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *
my body also shall rest in hope.
10	For you will not abandon me to the grave, *
nor let your holy one see the Pit.
11	You will show me the path of life; *
in your presence there is fullness of joy,
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.
