Ecce, quam bonum!
1	Oh, how good and pleasant it is, *
when brethren live together in unity!
2	It is like fine oil upon the head *
that runs down upon the beard,
3	Upon the beard of Aaron, *
and runs down upon the collar of his robe.
4	It is like the dew of Hermon *
that falls upon the hills of Zion.
5	For there the LORD has ordained the blessing: *
life for evermore.
