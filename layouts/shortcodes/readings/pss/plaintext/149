Cantate Domino
1	Hallelujah!
Sing to the LORD a new song; *
sing his praise in the congregation of the faithful.
2	Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; *
let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
3	Let them praise his Name in the dance; *
let them sing praise to him with timbrel and harp.
4	For the LORD takes pleasure in his people *
and adorns the poor with victory.
5	Let the faithful rejoice in triumph; *
let them be joyful on their beds.
6	Let the praises of God be in their throat *
and a two-edged sword in their hand;
7	To wreak vengeance on the nations *
and punishment on the peoples;
8	To bind their kings in chains *
and their nobles with links of iron;
9	To inflict on them the judgment decreed; *
this is glory for all his faithful people.
Hallelujah!
