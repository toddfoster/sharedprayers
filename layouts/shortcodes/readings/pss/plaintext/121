Levavi oculos
1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *
from where is my help to come?
2	My help comes from the LORD, *
the maker of heaven and earth.
3	He will not let your foot be moved *
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.
4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *
shall neither slumber nor sleep;
5	The LORD himself watches over you; *
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,
6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *
nor the moon by night.
7	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; *
it is he who shall keep you safe.
8	The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *
from this time forth for evermore.
