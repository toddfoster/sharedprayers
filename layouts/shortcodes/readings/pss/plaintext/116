Dilexi, quoniam
1	I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever
I called upon him.
2	The cords of death entangled me;
the grip of the grave took hold of me; *
I came to grief and sorrow.
3	Then I called upon the Name of the LORD: *
"O LORD, I pray you, save my life."
4	Gracious is the LORD and righteous; *
our God is full of compassion.
5	The LORD watches over the innocent; *
I was brought very low, and he helped me.
6	Turn again to your rest, O my soul. *
for the LORD has treated you well.
7	For you have rescued my life from death, *
my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
8	I will walk in the presence of the LORD *
in the land of the living.
9	I believed, even when I said,
"I have been brought very low." *
In my distress I said, "No one can be trusted."
10	How shall I repay the LORD *
for all the good things he has done for me?
11	I will lift up the cup of salvation *
and call upon the Name of the LORD.
12	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *
in the presence of all his people.
13	Precious in the sight of the LORD *
is the death of his servants.
14	O LORD, I am your servant; *
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;
you have freed me from my bonds.
15	I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *
and call upon the Name of the LORD.
16	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *
in the presence of all his people,
17	In the courts of the LORD'S house, *
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
Hallelujah!
