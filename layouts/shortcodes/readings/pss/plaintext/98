Cantate Domino
1	Sing to the LORD a new song, *
for he has done marvelous things.
2	With his right hand and his holy arm *
has he won for himself the victory.
3	The LORD has made known his victory; *
his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.
4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
5	Shout with joy to the LORD, all you lands; *
lift up your voice, rejoice, and sing.
6	Sing to the LORD with the harp, *
with the harp and the voice of song.
7	With trumpets and the sound of the horn *
shout with joy before the King, the LORD.
8	Let the sea make a noise and all that is in it, *
the lands and those who dwell therein.
9	Let the rivers clap their hands, *
and let the hills ring out with joy before the LORD,
when he comes to judge the earth.
10	In righteousness shall he judge the world *
and the peoples with equity.
