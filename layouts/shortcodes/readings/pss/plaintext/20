Exaudiat te Dominus
1	May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble, *
the Name of the God of Jacob defend you;
2	Send you help from his holy place *
and strengthen you out of Zion;
3	Remember all your offerings *
and accept your burnt sacrifice;
4	Grant you your heart's desire *
and prosper all your plans.
5	We will shout for joy at your victory
and triumph in the Name of our God; *
may the LORD grant all your requests.
6	Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his anointed; *
he will answer him out of his holy heaven,
with the victorious strength of his right hand.
7	Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, *
but we will call upon the Name of the LORD our God.
8	They collapse and fall down, *
but we will arise and stand upright.
9	O LORD, give victory to the king *
and answer us when we call.
