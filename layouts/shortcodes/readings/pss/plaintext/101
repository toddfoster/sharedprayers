Misericordiam et judicium
1	I will sing of mercy and justice; *
to you, O LORD, will I sing praises.
2	I will strive to follow a blameless course;
oh, when will you come to me? *
I will walk with sincerity of heart within my house.
3	I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; *
I hate the doers of evil deeds;
they shall not remain with me.
4	A crooked heart shall be far from me; *
I will not know evil.
5	Those who in secret slander their neighbors I will destroy; *
those who have a haughty look and a proud heart I cannot abide.
6	My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me, *
and only those who lead a blameless life shall be my servants.
7	Those who act deceitfully shall not dwell in my house, *
and those who tell lies shall not continue in my sight.
8	I will soon destroy all the wicked in the land, *
that I may root out all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
