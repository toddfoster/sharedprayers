Dixi, Custodiam
1	I said, "I will keep watch upon my ways, *
so that I do not offend with my tongue.
2	I will put a muzzle on my mouth *
while the wicked are in my presence."
3	So I held my tongue and said nothing; *
I refrained from rash words;
but my pain became unbearable.
4	My heart was hot within me;
while I pondered, the fire burst into flame; *
I spoke out with my tongue:
5	LORD, let me know my end and the number of my days, *
so that I may know how short my life is.
6	You have given me a mere handful of days,
and my lifetime is as nothing in your sight; *
truly, even those who stand erect are but a puff of wind.
7	We walk about like a shadow,
and in vain we are in turmoil; *
we heap up riches and cannot tell who will gather them.
8	And now, what is my hope? *
O Lord, my hope is in you.
9	Deliver me from all my transgressions *
and do not make me the taunt of the fool.
10	I fell silent and did not open my mouth, *
for surely it was you that did it.
11	Take your affliction from me; *
I am worn down by the blows of your hand.
12	With rebukes for sin you punish us;
like a moth you eat away all that is dear to us; *
truly, everyone is but a puff of wind.
13	Hear my prayer, O LORD,
and give ear to my cry; *
hold not your peace at my tears.
14	For I am but a sojourner with you, *
a wayfarer, as all my forebears were.
15	Turn your gaze from me, that I may be glad again, *
before I go my way and am no more.
