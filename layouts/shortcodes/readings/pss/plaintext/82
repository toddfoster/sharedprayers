Deus stetit
1	God takes his stand in the council of heaven; *
he gives judgment in the midst of the gods:
2	"How long will you judge unjustly, *
and show favor to the wicked?
3	Save the weak and the orphan; *
defend the humble and needy;
4	Rescue the weak and the poor; *
deliver them from the power of the wicked.
5	They do not know, neither do they understand;
they go about in darkness; *
all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
6	Now I say to you, 'You are gods, *
and all of you children of the Most High;
7	Nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, *
and fall like any prince.'"
8	Arise, O God, and rule the earth, *
for you shall take all nations for your own.
