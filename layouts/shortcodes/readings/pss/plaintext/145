Exaltabo te, Deus
1	I will exalt you, O God my King, *
and bless your Name for ever and ever.
2	Every day will I bless you *
and praise your Name for ever and ever.
3	Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *
there is no end to his greatness.
4	One generation shall praise your works to another *
and shall declare your power.
5	I will ponder the glorious splendor of your majesty *
and all your marvelous works.
6	They shall speak of the might of your wondrous acts, *
and I will tell of your greatness.
7	They shall publish the remembrance of your great goodness; *
they shall sing of your righteous deeds.
8	The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, *
slow to anger and of great kindness.
9	The LORD is loving to everyone *
and his compassion is over all his works.
10	All your works praise you, O LORD, *
and your faithful servants bless you.
11	They make known the glory of your kingdom *
and speak of your power;
12	That the peoples may know of your power *
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
13	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; *
your dominion endures throughout all ages.
14	The LORD is faithful in all his words *
and merciful in all his deeds.
15	The LORD upholds all those who fall; *
he lifts up those who are bowed down.
16	The eyes of all wait upon you, O LORD, *
and you give them their food in due season.
17	You open wide your hand *
and satisfy the needs of every living creature.
18	The LORD is righteous in all his ways *
and loving in all his works.
19	The LORD is near to those who call upon him, *
to all who call upon him faithfully.
20	He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; *
he hears their cry and helps them.
21	The LORD preserves all those who love him, *
but he destroys all the wicked.
22	My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; *
let all flesh bless his holy Name for ever and ever.
