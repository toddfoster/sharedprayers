Quid gloriaris?
1	You tyrant, why do you boast of wickedness *
against the godly all day long?
2	You plot ruin;
your tongue is like a sharpened razor, *
O worker of deception.
3	You love evil more than good *
and lying more than speaking the truth.
4	You love all words that hurt, *
O you deceitful tongue.
5	Oh, that God would demolish you utterly, *
topple you, and snatch you from your dwelling,
and root you out of the land of the living!
6	The righteous shall see and tremble, *
and they shall laugh at him, saying,
7	"This is the one who did not take God for a refuge, *
but trusted in great wealth
and relied upon wickedness."
8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; *
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
9	I will give you thanks for what you have done *
and declare the goodness of your Name in the presence of the godly.
