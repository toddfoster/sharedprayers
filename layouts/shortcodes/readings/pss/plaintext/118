Confitemini Domino
1	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; *
his mercy endures for ever.
2	Let Israel now proclaim, *
"His mercy endures for ever."
3	Let the house of Aaron now proclaim, *
"His mercy endures for ever."
4	Let those who fear the LORD now proclaim, *
"His mercy endures for ever."
5	I called to the LORD in my distress; *
the LORD answered by setting me free.
6	The LORD is at my side, therefore I will not fear; *
what can anyone do to me?
7	The LORD is at my side to help me; *
I will triumph over those who hate me.
8	It is better to rely on the LORD *
than to put any trust in flesh.
9	It is better to rely on the LORD *
than to put any trust in rulers.
10	All the ungodly encompass me; *
in the Name of the LORD I will repel them.
11	They hem me in, they hem me in on every side; *
in the name of the LORD I will repel them.
12	They swarm about me like bees;
they blaze like a fire of thorns; *
in the name of the LORD I will repel them.
13	I was pressed so hard that I almost fell, *
but the LORD came to my help.
14	The LORD is my strength and my song, *
and he has become my salvation.
15	There is a sound of exultation and victory *
in the tents of the righteous:
16	"The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! *
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!"
17	I shall not die, but live, *
and declare the works of the LORD.
18	The LORD has punished me sorely, *
but he did not hand me over to death.
19	Open for me the gates of righteousness; *
I will enter them;
I will offer thanks to the LORD.
20	"This is the gate of the LORD; *
he who is righteous may enter."
21	I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *
and have become my salvation.
22	The same stone which the builders rejected *
has become the chief cornerstone.
23	This is the LORD'S doing, *
and it is marvelous in our eyes.
24	On this day the LORD has acted; *
we will rejoice and be glad in it.
25	Hosanna, LORD, hosanna! *
LORD, send us now success.
26	Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; *
we bless you from the house of the LORD.
27	God is the LORD; he has shined upon us; *
form a procession with branches up to the horns of the altar.
28	"You are my God, and I will thank you; *
you are my God, and I will exalt you."
29	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; *
his mercy endures for ever.
