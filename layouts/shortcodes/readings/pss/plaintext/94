Deus ultionum
1	O LORD God of vengeance, *
O God of vengeance, show yourself.
2	Rise up, O Judge of the world; *
give the arrogant their just deserts.
3	How long shall the wicked, O LORD, *
how long shall the wicked triumph?
4	They bluster in their insolence; *
all evildoers are full of boasting.
5	They crush your people, O LORD, *
and afflict your chosen nation.
6	They murder the widow and the stranger *
and put the orphans to death.
7	Yet they say, "The LORD does not see, *
the God of Jacob takes no notice."
8	Consider well, you dullards among the people; *
when will you fools understand?
9	He that planted the ear, does he not hear? *
he that formed the eye, does he not see?
10	He who admonishes the nations, will he not punish? *
he who teaches all the world, has he no knowledge?
11	The LORD knows our human thoughts; *
how like a puff of wind they are.
12	Happy are they whom you instruct, O Lord! *
whom you teach out of your law;
13	To give them rest in evil days, *
until a pit is dug for the wicked.
14	For the LORD will not abandon his people, *
nor will he forsake his own.
15	For judgment will again be just, *
and all the true of heart will follow it.
16	Who rose up for me against the wicked? *
who took my part against the evildoers?
17	If the LORD had not come to my help, *
I should soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
18	As often as I said, "My foot has slipped," *
your love, O LORD, upheld me.
19	When many cares fill my mind, *
your consolations cheer my soul.
20	Can a corrupt tribunal have any part with you, *
one which frames evil into law?
21	They conspire against the life of the just *
and condemn the innocent to death.
22	But the LORD has become my stronghold, *
and my God the rock of my trust.
23	He will turn their wickedness back upon them
and destroy them in their own malice; *
the LORD our God will destroy them.
