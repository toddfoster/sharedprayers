Eructavit cor meum
1	My heart is stirring with a noble song;
let me recite what I have fashioned for the king; *
my tongue shall be the pen of a skilled writer.
2	You are the fairest of men; *
grace flows from your lips,
because God has blessed you for ever.
3	Strap your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior, *
in your pride and in your majesty.
4	Ride out and conquer in the cause of truth *
and for the sake of justice.
5	Your right hand will show you marvelous things; *
your arrows are very sharp, O mighty warrior.
6	The peoples are falling at your feet, *
and the king's enemies are losing heart.
7	Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever, *
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom;
you love righteousness and hate iniquity.
8	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you *
with the oil of gladness above your fellows.
9	All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, *
and the music of strings from ivory palaces makes you glad.
10	Kings' daughters stand among the ladies of the court; *
on your right hand is the queen,
adorned with the gold of Ophir.
11	"Hear, O daughter; consider and listen closely; *
forget your people and your father's house.
12	The king will have pleasure in your beauty; *
he is your master; therefore do him honor.
13	The people of Tyre are here with a gift; *
the rich among the people seek your favor."
14	All glorious is the princess as she enters; *
her gown is cloth-of-gold.
15	In embroidered apparel she is brought to the king; *
after her the bridesmaids follow in procession.
16	With joy and gladness they are brought, *
and enter into the palace of the king.
17	"In place of fathers, O king, you shall have sons; *
you shall make them princes over all the earth.
18	I will make your name to be remembered
from one generation to another; *
therefore nations will praise you for ever and ever."
