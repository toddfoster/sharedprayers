Jubilate Deo
1	Be joyful in God, all you lands; *
sing the glory of his Name;
sing the glory of his praise.
2	Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! *
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.
3	All the earth bows down before you, *
sings to you, sings out your Name."
4	Come now and see the works of God, *
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.
5	He turned the sea into dry land,
so that they went through the water on foot, *
and there we rejoiced in him.
6	In his might he rules for ever;
his eyes keep watch over the nations; *
let no rebel rise up against him.
7	Bless our God, you peoples; *
make the voice of his praise to be heard;
8	Who holds our souls in life, *
and will not allow our feet to slip.
9	For you, O God, have proved us; *
you have tried us just as silver is tried.
10	You brought us into the snare; *
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.
11	You let enemies ride over our heads;
we went through fire and water; *
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.
12	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings
and will pay you my vows, *
which I promised with my lips
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.
13	I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts
with the smoke of rams; *
I will give you oxen and goats.
14	Come and listen, all you who fear God, *
and I will tell you what he has done for me.
15	I called out to him with my mouth, *
and his praise was on my tongue.
16	If I had found evil in my heart, *
the Lord would not have heard me;
17	But in truth God has heard me; *
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
18	Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *
nor withheld his love from me.
