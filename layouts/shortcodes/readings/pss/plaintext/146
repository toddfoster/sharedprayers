Lauda, anima mea
1	Hallelujah!
Praise the LORD, O my soul! *
I will praise the LORD as long as I live;
I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
2	Put not your trust in rulers, nor in any child of earth, *
for there is no help in them.
3	When they breathe their last, they return to earth, *
and in that day their thoughts perish.
4	Happy are they who have the God of Jacob for their help! *
whose hope is in the LORD their God;
5	Who made heaven and earth, the seas, and all that is in them; *
who keeps his promise for ever;
6	Who gives justice to those who are oppressed, *
and food to those who hunger.
7	The LORD sets the prisoners free;
the LORD opens the eyes of the blind; *
the LORD lifts up those who are bowed down;
8	The LORD loves the righteous;
the LORD cares for the stranger; *
he sustains the orphan and widow,
but frustrates the way of the wicked.
9	The LORD shall reign for ever, *
your God, O Zion, throughout all generations.
Hallelujah!
