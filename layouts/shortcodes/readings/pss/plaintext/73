Quam bonus Israel!
1	Truly, God is good to Israel, *
to those who are pure in heart.
2	But as for me, my feet had nearly slipped; *
I had almost tripped and fallen;
3	Because I envied the proud *
and saw the prosperity of the wicked:
4	For they suffer no pain, *
and their bodies are sleek and sound;
5	In the misfortunes of others they have no share; *
they are not afflicted as others are;
6	Therefore they wear their pride like a necklace *
and wrap their violence about them like a cloak.
7	Their iniquity comes from gross minds, *
and their hearts overflow with wicked thoughts.
8	They scoff and speak maliciously; *
out of their haughtiness they plan oppression.
9	They set their mouths against the heavens, *
and their evil speech runs through the world.
10	And so the people turn to them *
and find in them no fault.
11	They say, "How should God know? *
is there knowledge in the Most High?"
12	So then, these are the wicked; *
always at ease, they increase their wealth.
13	In vain have I kept my heart clean, *
and washed my hands in innocence.
14	I have been afflicted all day long, *
and punished every morning.
15	Had I gone on speaking this way, *
I should have betrayed the generation of your children.
16	When I tried to understand these things, *
it was too hard for me;
17	Until I entered the sanctuary of God *
and discerned the end of the wicked.
18	Surely, you set them in slippery places; *
you cast them down in ruin.
19	Oh, how suddenly do they come to destruction, *
come to an end, and perish from terror!
20	Like a dream when one awakens, O Lord, *
when you arise you will make their image vanish.
21	When my mind became embittered, *
I was sorely wounded in my heart.
22	I was stupid and had no understanding; *
I was like a brute beast in your presence.
23	Yet I am always with you; *
you hold me by my right hand.
24	You will guide me by your counsel, *
and afterwards receive me with glory.
25	Whom have I in heaven but you? *
and having you I desire nothing upon earth.
26	Though my flesh and my heart should waste away, *
God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
27	Truly, those who forsake you will perish; *
you destroy all who are unfaithful.
28	But it is good for me to be near God; *
I have made the Lord GOD my refuge.
29	I will speak of all your works *
in the gates of the city of Zion.
