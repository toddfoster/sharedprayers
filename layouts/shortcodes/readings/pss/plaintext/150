Laudate Dominum
1	Hallelujah!
Praise God in his holy temple; *
praise him in the firmament of his power.
2	Praise him for his mighty acts; *
praise him for his excellent greatness.
3	Praise him with the blast of the ram's-horn; *
praise him with lyre and harp.
4	Praise him with timbrel and dance; *
praise him with strings and pipe.
5	Praise him with resounding cymbals; *
praise him with loud-clanging cymbals.
6	Let everything that has breath *
praise the Lord.
Hallelujah!
