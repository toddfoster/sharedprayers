Confitebor tibi
1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *
I will tell of all your marvelous works.
2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; *
I will sing to your Name, O Most High.
3	When my enemies are driven back, *
they will stumble and perish at your presence.
4	For you have maintained my right and my cause; *
you sit upon your throne judging right.
5	You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *
you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
6	As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *
their cities plowed under, the memory of them perished;
7	But the LORD is enthroned for ever; *
he has set up his throne for judgment.
8	It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *
he judges the peoples with equity.
9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, *
a refuge in time of trouble.
10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *
for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.
11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; *
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.
12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; *
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.
13	Have pity on me, O LORD; *
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;
14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation *
in the gates of the city of Zion.
15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.
16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; *
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.
17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *
and also all the people that forget God.
18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.
19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *
let them be judged before you.
20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; *
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.
