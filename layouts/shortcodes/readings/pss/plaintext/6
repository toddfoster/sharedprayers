Domine, ne in furore
1	LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; *
do not punish me in your wrath.
2	Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak; *
heal me, LORD, for my bones are racked.
3	My spirit shakes with terror; *
how long, O LORD, how long?
4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; *
save me for your mercy's sake.
5	For in death no one remembers you; *
and who will give you thanks in the grave?
6	I grow weary because of my groaning; *
every night I drench my bed
and flood my couch with tears.
7	My eyes are wasted with grief *
and worn away because of all my enemies.
8	Depart from me, all evildoers, *
for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
9	The LORD has heard my supplication; *
the LORD accepts my prayer.
10	All my enemies shall be confounded and quake with fear; *
they shall turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
