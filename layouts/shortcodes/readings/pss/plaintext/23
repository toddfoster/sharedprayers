Dominus regit me
1	The LORD is my shepherd; *
I shall not be in want.
2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *
and leads me beside still waters.
3	He revives my soul *
and guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake.
4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil; *
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *
you have anointed my head with oil,
and my cup is running over.
6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
