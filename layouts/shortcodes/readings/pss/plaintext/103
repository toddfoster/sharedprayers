Benedic, anima mea
1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.
2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
and forget not all his benefits.
3	He forgives all your sins *
and heals all your infirmities;
4	He redeems your life from the grave *
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;
5	He satisfies you with good things, *
and your youth is renewed like an eagle's.
6	The LORD executes righteousness *
and judgment for all who are oppressed.
7	He made his ways known to Moses *
and his works to the children of Israel.
8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *
slow to anger and of great kindness.
9	He will not always accuse us, *
nor will he keep his anger for ever.
10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.
11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *
so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.
12	As far as the east is from the west, *
so far has he removed our sins from us.
13	As a father cares for his children, *
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.
14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *
he remembers that we are but dust.
15	Our days are like the grass; *
we flourish like a flower of the field;
16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *
and its place shall know it no more.
17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever
on those who fear him, *
and his righteousness on children's children;
18	On those who keep his covenant *
and remember his commandments and do them.
19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *
and his kingship has dominion over all.
20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
you mighty ones who do his bidding, *
and hearken to the voice of his word.
21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *
you ministers of his who do his will.
22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,
in all places of his dominion; *
bless the LORD, O my soul.
