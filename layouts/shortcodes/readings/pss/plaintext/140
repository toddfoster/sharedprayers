Eripe me, Domine
1	Deliver me, O LORD, from evildoers; *
protect me from the violent,
2	Who devise evil in their hearts *
and stir up strife all day long.
3	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; *
adder's poison is under their lips.
4	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; *
protect me from the violent,
who are determined to trip me up.
5	The proud have hidden a snare for me
and stretched out a net of cords; *
they have set traps for me along the path.
6	I have said to the LORD, "You are my God; *
listen, O LORD, to my supplication.
7	O Lord GOD, the strength of my salvation, *
you have covered my head in the day of battle.
8	Do not grant the desires of the wicked, O LORD, *
nor let their evil plans prosper.
9	Let not those who surround me lift up their heads; *
let the evil of their lips overwhelm them.
10	Let hot burning coals fall upon them; *
let them be cast into the mire, never to rise up again."
11	A slanderer shall not be established on the earth, *
and evil shall hunt down the lawless.
12	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor *
and render justice to the needy.
13	Surely, the righteous will give thanks to your Name, *
and the upright shall continue in your sight.
