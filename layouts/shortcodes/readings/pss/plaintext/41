Beatus qui intelligit
1	Happy are they who consider the poor and needy! *
the LORD will deliver them in the time of trouble.
2	The LORD preserves them and keeps them alive,
so that they may be happy in the land; *
he does not hand them over to the will of their enemies.
3	The LORD sustains them on their sickbed *
and ministers to them in their illness.
4	I said, "LORD, be merciful to me; *
heal me, for I have sinned against you."
5	My enemies are saying wicked things about me: *
When will he die, and his name perish?"
6	Even if they come to see me, they speak empty words; *
their heart collects false rumors;
they go outside and spread them.
7	All my enemies whisper together about me *
and devise evil against me.
8	"A deadly thing," they say, "has fastened on him; *
he has taken to his bed and will never get up again."
9	Even my best friend, whom I trusted,
who broke bread with me, *
has lifted up his heel and turned against me.
10	But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up, *
and I shall repay them.
11	By this I know you are pleased with me, *
that my enemy does not triumph over me.
12	In my integrity you hold me fast, *
and shall set me before your face for ever.
13	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, *
from age to age. Amen. Amen.
