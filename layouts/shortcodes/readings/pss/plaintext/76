Notus in Jud≈ìa
1	In Judah is God known; *
his Name is great in Israel.
2	At Salem is his tabernacle, *
and his dwelling is in Zion.
3	There he broke the flashing arrows, *
the shield, the sword, and the weapons of battle.
4	How glorious you are! *
more splendid than the everlasting mountains!
5	The strong of heart have been despoiled;
they sink into sleep; *
none of the warriors can lift a hand.
6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, *
both horse and rider lie stunned.
7	What terror you inspire! *
who can stand before you when you are angry?
8	From heaven you pronounced judgment; *
the earth was afraid and was still;
9	When God rose up to judgment *
and to save all the oppressed of the earth.
10	Truly, wrathful Edom will give you thanks, *
and the remnant of Hamath will keep your feasts.
11	Make a vow to the LORD your God and keep it; *
let all around him bring gifts to him who is worthy to be feared.
12	He breaks the spirit of princes, *
and strikes terror in the kings of the earth.
