Deus, in nomine
1	Save me, O God, by your Name; *
in your might, defend my cause.
2	Hear my prayer, O God; *
give ear to the words of my mouth.
3	For the arrogant have risen up against me,
and the ruthless have sought my life, *
those who have no regard for God.
4	Behold, God is my helper; *
it is the Lord who sustains my life.
5	Render evil to those who spy on me; *
in your faithfulness, destroy them.
6	I will offer you a freewill sacrifice *
and praise your Name, O LORD, for it is good.
7	For you have rescued me from every trouble, *
and my eye has seen the ruin of my foes.
