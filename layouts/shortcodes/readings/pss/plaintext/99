Dominus regnavit
1	The LORD is King;
let the people tremble; *
he is enthroned upon the cherubim;
let the earth shake.
2	The LORD is great in Zion; *
he is high above all peoples.
3	Let them confess his Name, which is great and awesome; *
he is the Holy One.
4	"O mighty King, lover of justice,
you have established equity; *
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob."
5	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God
and fall down before his footstool; *
he is the Holy One.
6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
7	He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; *
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.
8	"O LORD our God, you answered them indeed; *
you were a God who forgave them,
yet punished them for their evil deeds."
9	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God
and worship him upon his holy hill; *
for the LORD our God is the Holy One.
