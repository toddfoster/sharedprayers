Miserere mei, Deus
1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; *
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.
2	Wash me through and through from my wickedness *
and cleanse me from my sin.
3	For I know my transgressions, *
and my sin is ever before me.
4	Against you only have I sinned *
and done what is evil in your sight.
5	And so you are justified when you speak *
and upright in your judgment.
6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *
a sinner from my mother's womb.
7	For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *
and will make me understand wisdom secretly
8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.
9	Make me hear of joy and gladness, *
that the body you have broken may rejoice.
10	Hide your face from my sins *
and blot out all my iniquities.
11	Create in me a clean heart, O God, *
and renew a right spirit within me.
12	Cast me not away from your presence *
and take not your holy Spirit from me.
13	Give me the joy of your saving help again *
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
14	I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *
and sinners shall return to you.
15	Deliver me from death, O God, *
and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,
O God of my salvation.
16	Open my lips, O Lord, *
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
17	Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice, *
but you take no delight in burnt-offerings.
18	The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *
a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
19	Be favorable and gracious to Zion, *
and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
20	Then you will be pleased with the appointed sacrifices,
with burnt-offerings and oblations; *
then shall they offer young bullocks upon your altar.
