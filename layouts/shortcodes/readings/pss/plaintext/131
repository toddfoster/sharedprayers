Domine, non est
1	O LORD, I am not proud; *
I have no haughty looks.
2	I do not occupy myself with great matters, *
or with things that are too hard for me.
3	But I still my soul and make it quiet,
like a child upon its mother's breast; *
my soul is quieted within me.
4	O Israel, wait upon the LORD, *
from this time forth for evermore.
