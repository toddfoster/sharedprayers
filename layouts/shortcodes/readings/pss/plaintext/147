Laudate Dominum
1	Hallelujah!
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!
2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *
he gathers the exiles of Israel.
3	He heals the brokenhearted *
and binds up their wounds.
4	He counts the number of the stars *
and calls them all by their names.
5	Great is our LORD and mighty in power; *
there is no limit to his wisdom.
6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, *
but casts the wicked to the ground.
7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *
make music to our God upon the harp.
8	He covers the heavens with clouds *
and prepares rain for the earth;
9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *
and green plants to serve mankind.
10	He provides food for flocks and herds *
and for the young ravens when they cry.
11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;
12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *
in those who await his gracious favor.
13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *
praise your God, O Zion;
14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; *
he has blessed your children within you.
15	He has established peace on your borders; *
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.
16	He sends out his command to the earth, *
and his word runs very swiftly.
17	He gives snow like wool; *
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.
18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; *
who can stand against his cold?
19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.
20	He declares his word to Jacob, *
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.
21	He has not done so to any other nation; *
to them he has not revealed his judgments.
Hallelujah!
