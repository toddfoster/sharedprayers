Laudate, pueri
1	Hallelujah!
Give praise, you servants of the LORD; *
praise the Name of the LORD.
2	Let the Name of the LORD be blessed, *
from this time forth for evermore.
3	From the rising of the sun to its going down *
let the Name of the LORD be praised.
4	The LORD is high above all nations, *
and his glory above the heavens.
5	Who is like the LORD our God, who sits enthroned on high, *
but stoops to behold the heavens and the earth?
6	He takes up the weak out of the dust *
and lifts up the poor from the ashes.
7	He sets them with the princes, *
with the princes of his people.
8	He makes the woman of a childless house *
to be a joyful mother of children.
