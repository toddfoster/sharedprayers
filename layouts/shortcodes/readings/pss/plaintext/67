Deus misereatur
1	May God be merciful to us and bless us, *
show us the light of his countenance and come to us.
2	Let your ways be known upon earth, *
your saving health among all nations.
3	Let the peoples praise you, O God; *
let all the peoples praise you.
4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, *
for you judge the peoples with equity
and guide all the nations upon earth.
5	Let the peoples praise you, O God; *
let all the peoples praise you.
6	The earth has brought forth her increase; *
may God, our own God, give us his blessing.
7	May God give us his blessing, *
and may all the ends of the earth stand in awe of him.
