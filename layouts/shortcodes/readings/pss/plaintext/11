In Domino confido
1	In the LORD have I taken refuge; *
how then can you say to me,
"Fly away like a bird to the hilltop;
2	For see how the wicked bend the bow
and fit their arrows to the string, *
to shoot from ambush at the true of heart.
3	When the foundations are being destroyed, *
what can the righteous do?"
4	The LORD is in his holy temple; *
the LORD'S throne is in heaven.
5	His eyes behold the inhabited world; *
his piercing eye weighs our worth.
6	The LORD weighs the righteous as well as the wicked, *
but those who delight in violence he abhors.
7	Upon the wicked he shall rain coals of fire and burning sulphur; *
a scorching wind shall be their lot.
8	For the LORD is righteous;
he delights in righteous deeds; *
and the just shall see his face.
