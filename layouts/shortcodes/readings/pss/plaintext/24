Domini est terra
1	The earth is the LORD'S and all that is in it, *
the world and all who dwell therein.
2	For it is he who founded it upon the seas *
and made it firm upon the rivers of the deep.
3	"Who can ascend the hill of the LORD? *
and who can stand in his holy place?"
4	"Those who have clean hands and a pure heart, *
who have not pledged themselves to falsehood,
nor sworn by what is a fraud.
5	They shall receive a blessing from the LORD *
and a just reward from the God of their salvation."
6	Such is the generation of those who seek him, *
of those who seek your face, O God of Jacob.
7	Lift up your heads, O gates;
lift them high, O everlasting doors; *
and the King of glory shall come in.
8	"Who is this King of glory?" *
"The LORD, strong and mighty,
the LORD, mighty in battle."
9	Lift up your heads, O gates;
lift them high, O everlasting doors; *
and the King of glory shall come in.
10	"Who is he, this King of glory?" *
"The LORD of hosts,
he is the King of glory."
