Cum invocarem
1	Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
2	"You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *
how long will you worship dumb idols
and run after false gods?"
3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.
4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; *
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.
5	Offer the appointed sacrifices *
and put your trust in the LORD.
6	Many are saying,
"Oh, that we might see better times!" *
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.
7	You have put gladness in my heart, *
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.
8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.
