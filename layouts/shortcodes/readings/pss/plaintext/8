Domine, Dominus noster
1	O LORD our Governor, *
how exalted is your Name in all the world!
2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *
your majesty is praised above the heavens.
3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *
to quell the enemy and the avenger.
4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,
5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *
the son of man that you should seek him out?
6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *
you adorn him with glory and honor;
7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *
you put all things under his feet:
8	All sheep and oxen, *
even the wild beasts of the field,
9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.
10	O LORD our Governor, *
how exalted is your Name in all the world!
