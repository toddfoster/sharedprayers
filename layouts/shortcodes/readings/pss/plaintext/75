Confitebimur tibi
1	We give you thanks, O God, we give you thanks, *
calling upon your Name and declaring all your wonderful deeds.
2	"I will appoint a time," says God; *
"I will judge with equity.
3	Though the earth and all its inhabitants are quaking, *
I will make its pillars fast.
4	I will say to the boasters, 'Boast no more,' *
and to the wicked, 'Do not toss your horns;
5	Do not toss your horns so high, *
nor speak with a proud neck.'"
6	For judgment is neither from the east nor from the west, *
nor yet from the wilderness or the mountains.
7	It is God who judges; *
he puts down one and lifts up another.
8	For in the LORD'S hand there is a cup,
full of spiced and foaming wine, which he pours out, *
and all the wicked of the earth shall drink and
drain the dregs.
9	But I will rejoice for ever; *
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
10	He shall break off all the horns of the wicked; *
but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
