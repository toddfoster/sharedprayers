Dominus illuminatio
1	The LORD is my light and my salvation;
whom then shall I fear? *
the LORD is the strength of my life;
of whom then shall I be afraid?
2	When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, *
it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell.
3	Though an army should encamp against me, *
yet my heart shall not be afraid;
4	And though war should rise up against me, *
yet will I put my trust in him.
5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;
one thing I seek; *
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days
of my life;
6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *
and to seek him in his temple.
7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; *
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling
and set me high upon a rock.
8	Even now he lifts up my head *
above my enemies round about me.
9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation
with sounds of great gladness; *
I will sing and make music to the LORD.
10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *
have mercy on me and answer me.
11	You speak in my heart and say, "Seek my face." *
Your face, LORD, will I seek.
12	Hide not your face from me, *
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.
13	You have been my helper;
cast me not away; *
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.
14	Though my father and my mother forsake me, *
the LORD will sustain me.
15	Show me your way, O LORD; *
lead me on a level path, because of my enemies.
16	Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, *
for false witnesses have risen up against me,
and also those who speak malice.
17	What if I had not believed
that I should see the goodness of the LORD *
in the land of the living!
18	O tarry and await the LORD'S pleasure;
be strong, and he shall comfort your heart; *
wait patiently for the LORD.
