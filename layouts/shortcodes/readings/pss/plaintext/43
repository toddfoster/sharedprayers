Judica me, Deus
1	Give judgment for me, O God,
and defend my cause against an ungodly people; *
deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.
2	For you are the God of my strength;
why have you put me from you? *
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy
oppresses me?
3	Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, *
and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling;
4	That I may go to the altar of God,
to the God of my joy and gladness; *
and on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.
5	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *
and why are you so disquieted within me?
6	Put your trust in God; *
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
