Miserere mei, Deus
1	Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful,
for I have taken refuge in you; *
in the shadow of your wings will I take refuge
until this time of trouble has gone by.
2	I will call upon the Most High God, *
the God who maintains my cause.
3	He will send from heaven and save me;
he will confound those who trample upon me; *
God will send forth his love and his faithfulness.
4	I lie in the midst of lions that devour the people; *
their teeth are spears and arrows,
their tongue a sharp sword.
5	They have laid a net for my feet,
and I am bowed low; *
they have dug a pit before me,
but have fallen into it themselves.
6	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *
and your glory over all the earth.
7	My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; *
I will sing and make melody.
8	Wake up, my spirit;
awake, lute and harp; *
I myself will waken the dawn.
9	I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *
I will sing praise to you among the nations.
10	For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, *
and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
11	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *
and your glory over all the earth.
