Exultate Deo
1	Sing with joy to God our strength *
and raise a loud shout to the God of Jacob.
2	Raise a song and sound the timbrel, *
the merry harp, and the lyre.
3	Blow the ram's-horn at the new moon, *
and at the full moon, the day of our feast.
4	For this is a statute for Israel, *
a law of the God of Jacob.
5	He laid it as a solemn charge upon Joseph, *
when he came out of the land of Egypt.
6	I heard an unfamiliar voice saying, *
"I eased his shoulder from the burden;
his hands were set free from bearing the load."
7	You called on me in trouble, and I saved you; *
I answered you from the secret place of thunder
and tested you at the waters of Meribah.
8	Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you: *
O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
9	There shall be no strange god among you; *
you shall not worship a foreign god.
10	I am the LORD your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt and said, *
"Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it."
11	And yet my people did not hear my voice, *
and Israel would not obey me.
12	So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their hearts, *
to follow their own devices.
13	Oh, that my people would listen to me! *
that Israel would walk in my ways!
14	I should soon subdue their enemies *
and turn my hand against their foes.
15	Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, *
and their punishment would last for ever.
16	But Israel would I feed with the finest wheat *
and satisfy him with honey from the rock.
