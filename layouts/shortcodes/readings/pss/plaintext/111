Confitebor tibi
1	Hallelujah!
I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, *
in the assembly of the upright, in the congregation.
2	Great are the deeds of the LORD! *
they are studied by all who delight in them.
3	His work is full of majesty and splendor, *
and his righteousness endures for ever.
4	He makes his marvelous works to be remembered; *
the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
5	He gives food to those who fear him; *
he is ever mindful of his covenant.
6	He has shown his people the power of his works *
in giving them the lands of the nations.
7	The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; *
all his commandments are sure.
8	They stand fast for ever and ever, *
because they are done in truth and equity.
9	He sent redemption to his people;
he commanded his covenant for ever; *
holy and awesome is his Name.
10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; *
those who act accordingly have a good understanding;
his praise endures for ever.
