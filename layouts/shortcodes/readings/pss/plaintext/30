Exaltabo te, Domine
1	I will exalt you, O LORD,
because you have lifted me up *
and have not let my enemies triumph over me.
2	O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *
and you restored me to health.
3	You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *
you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.
4	Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *
give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.
5	For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *
his favor for a lifetime.
6	Weeping may spend the night, *
but joy comes in the morning.
7	While I felt secure, I said,
I shall never be disturbed. *
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as
the mountains."
8	Then you hid your face, *
and I was filled with fear.
9	I cried to you, O LORD; *
I pleaded with the Lord, saying,
10	"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *
will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?
11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *
O LORD, be my helper."
12	You have turned my wailing into dancing; *
you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.
13	Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *
O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.
