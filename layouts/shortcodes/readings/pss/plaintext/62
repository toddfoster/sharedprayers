Nonne Deo?
1	For God alone my soul in silence waits; *
from him comes my salvation.
2	He alone is my rock and my salvation, *
my stronghold, so that I shall not be greatly shaken.
3	How long will you assail me to crush me,
all of you together, *
as if you were a leaning fence, a toppling wall?
4	They seek only to bring me down from my place of honor; *
lies are their chief delight.
5	They bless with their lips, *
but in their hearts they curse.
6	For God alone my soul in silence waits; *
truly, my hope is in him.
7	He alone is my rock and my salvation, *
my stronghold, so that I shall not be shaken.
8	In God is my safety and my honor; *
God is my strong rock and my refuge.
9	Put your trust in him always, O people, *
pour out your hearts before him, for God is our refuge.
10	Those of high degree are but a fleeting breath, *
even those of low estate cannot be trusted.
11	On the scales they are lighter than a breath, *
all of them together.
12	Put no trust in extortion;
in robbery take no empty pride; *
though wealth increase, set not your heart upon it.
13	God has spoken once, twice have I heard it, *
that power belongs to God.
14	Steadfast love is yours, O Lord, *
for you repay everyone according to his deeds.
