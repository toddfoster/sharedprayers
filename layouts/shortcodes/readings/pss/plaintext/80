Qui regis Israel
1	Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; *
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.
2	In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, *
stir up your strength and come to help us.
3	Restore us, O God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
4	O LORD God of hosts, *
how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your people?
5	You have fed them with the bread of tears; *
you have given them bowls of tears to drink.
6	You have made us the derision of our neighbors, *
and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
7	Restore us, O God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
8	You have brought a vine out of Egypt; *
you cast out the nations and planted it.
9	You prepared the ground for it; *
it took root and filled the land.
10	The mountains were covered by its shadow *
and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.
11	You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea *
and its branches to the River.
12	Why have you broken down its wall, *
so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?
13	The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, *
and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.
14	Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven;
behold and tend this vine; *
preserve what your right hand has planted.
15	They burn it with fire like rubbish; *
at the rebuke of your countenance let them perish.
16	Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, *
and son of man you have made so strong for yourself.
17	And so will we never turn away from you; *
give us life, that we may call upon your Name.
18	Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
