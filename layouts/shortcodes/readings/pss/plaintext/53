Dixit insipiens
1	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;
there is none who does any good.
2	God looks down from heaven upon us all, *
to see if there is any who is wise,
if there is one who seeks after God.
3	Every one has proved faithless;
all alike have turned bad; *
there is none who does good; no, not one.
4	Have they no knowledge, those evildoers *
who eat up my people like bread
and do not call upon God?
5	See how greatly they tremble,
such trembling as never was; *
for God has scattered the bones of the enemy;
they are put to shame, because God has rejected them.
6	Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *
when God restores the fortunes of his people
Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.
