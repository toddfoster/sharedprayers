Ut quid, Domine?
1	Why do you stand so far off, O LORD, *
and hide yourself in time of trouble?
2	The wicked arrogantly persecute the poor, *
but they are trapped in the schemes they have devised.
3	The wicked boast of their heart's desire; *
the covetous curse and revile the LORD.
4	The wicked are so proud that they care not for God; *
their only thought is, "God does not matter."
5	Their ways are devious at all times;
your judgments are far above out of their sight; *
they defy all their enemies.
6	They say in their heart, "I shall not be shaken; *
no harm shall happen to me ever."
7	Their mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; *
under their tongue are mischief and wrong.
8	They lurk in ambush in public squares
and in secret places they murder the innocent; *
they spy out the helpless.
9	They lie in wait, like a lion in a covert;
they lie in wait to seize upon the lowly; *
they seize the lowly and drag them away in their net.
10	The innocent are broken and humbled before them; *
the helpless fall before their power.
11	They say in their heart, "God has forgotten; *
he hides his face; he will never notice."
12	Rise up, O LORD;
lift up your hand, O God; *
do not forget the afflicted.
13	Why should the wicked revile God? *
why should they say in their heart, "You do not care"?
14	Surely, you behold trouble and misery; *
you see it and take it into your own hand.
15	The helpless commit themselves to you, *
for you are the helper of orphans.
16	Break the power of the wicked and evil; *
search out their wickedness until you find none.
17	The LORD is King for ever and ever; *
the ungodly shall perish from his land.
18	The LORD will hear the desire of the humble; *
you will strengthen their heart and your ears shall hear;
19	To give justice to the orphan and oppressed, *
so that mere mortals may strike terror no more.
