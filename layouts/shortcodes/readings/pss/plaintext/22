Deus, Deus meu
1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *
and are so far from my cry
and from the words of my distress?
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *
by night as well, but I find no rest.
3	Yet you are the Holy One, *
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *
they trusted, and you delivered them.
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.
6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *
scorned by all and despised by the people.
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,
8	"He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *
let him rescue him, if he delights in him."
9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *
and kept me safe upon my mother's breast.
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *
you were my God when I was still in my mother's womb.
11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *
and there is none to help.
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *
like a ravening and a roaring lion.
14	I am poured out like water;
all my bones are out of joint; *
my heart within my breast is melting wax.
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.
16	Packs of dogs close me in,
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *
they pierce my hands and my feet;
I can count all my bones.
17	They stare and gloat over me; *
they divide my garments among them;
they cast lots for my clothing.
18	Be not far away, O LORD; *
you are my strength; hasten to help me.
19	Save me from the sword, *
my life from the power of the dog.
20	Save me from the lion's mouth, *
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.
21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;
all you of Jacob's line, give glory.
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;
neither does he hide his face from them; *
but when they cry to him he hears them.
24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *
"May your heart live for ever!"
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *
and all the families of the nations bow before him.
27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *
he rules over the nations.
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *
all who go down to the dust fall before him.
29	My soul shall live for him;
my descendants shall serve him; *
they shall be known as the LORD'S for ever.
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *
the saving deeds that he has done.
