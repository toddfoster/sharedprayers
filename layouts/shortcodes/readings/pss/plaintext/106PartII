Part II
Et fecerunt vitulum
19	Israel made a bull-calf at Horeb *
and worshiped a molten image;
20	And so they exchanged their Glory *
for the image of an ox that feeds on grass.
21	They forgot God their Savior, *
who had done great things in Egypt,
22	Wonderful deeds in the land of Ham, *
and fearful things at the Red Sea.
23	So he would have destroyed them,
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, *
to turn away his wrath from consuming them.
24	They refused the pleasant land *
and would not believe his promise.
25	They grumbled in their tents *
and would not listen to the voice of the LORD.
26	So he lifted his hand against them, *
to overthrow them in the wilderness,
27	To cast out their seed among the nations, *
and to scatter them throughout the lands.
28	They joined themselves to Baal-Peor *
and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
29	They provoked him to anger with their actions, *
and a plague broke out among them.
30	Then Phinehas stood up and interceded, *
and the plague came to an end.
31	This was reckoned to him as righteousness *
throughout all generations for ever.
32	Again they provoked his anger at the waters of Meribah, *
so that he punished Moses because of them;
33	For they so embittered his spirit *
that he spoke rash words with his lips.
34	They did not destroy the peoples *
as the LORD had commanded them.
35	They intermingled with the heathen *
and learned their pagan ways,
36	So that they worshiped their idols, *
which became a snare to them.
37	They sacrificed their sons *
and their daughters to evil spirits.
38	They shed innocent blood,
the blood of their sons and daughters, *
which they offered to the idols of Canaan,
and the land was defiled with blood.
39	Thus they were polluted by their actions *
and went whoring in their evil deeds.
40	Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled against
his people *
and he abhorred his inheritance.
41	He gave them over to the hand of the heathen, *
and those who hated them ruled over them.
42	Their enemies oppressed them, *
and they were humbled under their hand.
43	Many a time did he deliver them,
but they rebelled through their own devices, *
and were brought down in their iniquity.
44	Nevertheless, he saw their distress, *
when he heard their lamentation.
45	He remembered his covenant with them *
and relented in accordance with his great mercy.
46	He caused them to be pitied *
by those who held them captive.
47	Save us, O LORD our God,
and gather us from among the nations, *
that we may give thanks to your holy Name
and glory in your praise.
48	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
from everlasting to everlasting; *
and let all the people say, "Amen!"
Hallelujah!
