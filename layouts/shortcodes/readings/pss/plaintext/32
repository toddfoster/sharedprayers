Beati quorum
1	Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *
and whose sin is put away!
2	Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *
and in whose spirit there is no guile!
3	While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *
because of my groaning all day long.
4	For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *
my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer.
5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *
and did not conceal my guilt.
6	I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD." *
Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin.
7	Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; *
when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them.
8	You are my hiding-place;
you preserve me from trouble; *
you surround me with shouts of deliverance.
9	"I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go; *
I will guide you with my eye.
10	Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; *
who must be fitted with bit and bridle,
or else they will not stay near you."
11	Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *
but mercy embraces those who trust in the LORD.
12	Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *
shout for joy, all who are true of heart.
