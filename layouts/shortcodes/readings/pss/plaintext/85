Benedixisti, Domine
1	You have been gracious to your land, O LORD, *
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.
2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *
and blotted out all their sins.
3	You have withdrawn all your fury *
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.
4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; *
let your anger depart from us.
5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? *
will you prolong your anger from age to age?
6	Will you not give us life again, *
that your people may rejoice in you?
7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, *
and grant us your salvation.
8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, *
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people
and to those who turn their hearts to him.
9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *
that his glory may dwell in our land.
10	Mercy and truth have met together; *
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, *
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, *
and our land will yield its increase.
13	Righteousness shall go before him, *
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.
