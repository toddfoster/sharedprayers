Voce mea ad Dominum
1	I will cry aloud to God; *
I will cry aloud, and he will hear me.
2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; *
my hands were stretched out by night and did not tire;
I refused to be comforted.
3	I think of God, I am restless, *
I ponder, and my spirit faints.
4	You will not let my eyelids close; *
I am troubled and I cannot speak.
5	I consider the days of old; *
I remember the years long past;
6	I commune with my heart in the night; *
I ponder and search my mind.
7	Will the Lord cast me off for ever? *
will he no more show his favor?
8	Has his loving-kindness come to an end for ever? *
has his promise failed for evermore?
9	Has God forgotten to be gracious? *
has he, in his anger, withheld his compassion?
10	And I said, "My grief is this: *
the right hand of the Most High has lost its power."
11	I will remember the works of the LORD, *
and call to mind your wonders of old time.
12	I will meditate on all your acts *
and ponder your mighty deeds.
13	Your way, O God, is holy; *
who is so great a god as our God?
14	You are the God who works wonders *
and have declared your power among the peoples.
15	By your strength you have redeemed your people, *
the children of Jacob and Joseph.
16	The waters saw you, O God;
the waters saw you and trembled; *
the very depths were shaken.
17	The clouds poured out water;
the skies thundered; *
your arrows flashed to and fro;
18	The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
your lightnings lit up the world; *
the earth trembled and shook.
19	Your way was in the sea,
and your paths in the great waters, *
yet your footsteps were not seen.
20	You led your people like a flock *
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
