Ut quid, Deus?
1	O God, why have you utterly cast us off? *
why is your wrath so hot against the sheep of your pasture?
2	Remember your congregation that you purchased long ago, *
the tribe you redeemed to be your inheritance,
and Mount Zion where you dwell.
3	Turn your steps toward the endless ruins; *
the enemy has laid waste everything in your sanctuary.
4	Your adversaries roared in your holy place; *
they set up their banners as tokens of victory.
5	They were like men coming up with axes to a grove of trees; *
they broke down all your carved work with hatchets and hammers.
6	They set fire to your holy place; *
they defiled the dwelling-place of your Name
and razed it to the ground.
7	They said to themselves, "Let us destroy them altogether." *
They burned down all the meeting-places of God in the land.
8	There are no signs for us to see;
there is no prophet left; *
there is not one among us who knows how long.
9	How long, O God, will the adversary scoff? *
will the enemy blaspheme your Name for ever?
10	Why do you draw back your hand? *
why is your right hand hidden in your bosom?
11	Yet God is my King from ancient times, *
victorious in the midst of the earth.
12	You divided the sea by your might *
and shattered the heads of the dragons upon the waters;
13	You crushed the heads of Leviathan *
and gave him to the people of the desert for food.
14	You split open spring and torrent; *
you dried up ever-flowing rivers.
15	Yours is the day, yours also the night; *
you established the moon and the sun.
16	You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; *
you made both summer and winter.
17	Remember, O LORD, how the enemy scoffed, *
how a foolish people despised your Name.
18	Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; *
never forget the lives of your poor.
19	Look upon your covenant; *
the dark places of the earth are haunts of violence.
20	Let not the oppressed turn away ashamed; *
let the poor and needy praise your Name.
21	Arise, O God, maintain your cause; *
remember how fools revile you all day long.
22	Forget not the clamor of your adversaries, *
the unending tumult of those who rise up against you.
