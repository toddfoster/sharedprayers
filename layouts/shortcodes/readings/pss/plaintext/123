Ad te levavi oculos meos
1	To you I lift up my eyes, *
to you enthroned in the heavens.
2	As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, *
and the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,
3	So our eyes look to the LORD our God, *
until he show us his mercy.
4	Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy, *
for we have had more than enough of contempt,
5	Too much of the scorn of the indolent rich, *
and of the derision of the proud.
