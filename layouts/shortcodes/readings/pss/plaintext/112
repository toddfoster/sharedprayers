Beatus vir
1	Hallelujah!
Happy are they who fear the Lord *
and have great delight in his commandments!
2	Their descendants will be mighty in the land; *
the generation of the upright will be blessed.
3	Wealth and riches will be in their house, *
and their righteousness will last for ever.
4	Light shines in the darkness for the upright; *
the righteous are merciful and full of compassion.
5	It is good for them to be generous in lending *
and to manage their affairs with justice.
6	For they will never be shaken; *
the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.
7	They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *
their heart is right;
they put their trust in the Lord.
8	Their heart is established and will not shrink, *
until they see their desire upon their enemies.
9	They have given freely to the poor, *
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;
they will hold up their head with honor.
10	The wicked will see it and be angry;
they will gnash their teeth and pine away; *
the desires of the wicked will perish.
