Dominus regnavit
1	The LORD is King;
let the earth rejoice; *
let the multitude of the isles be glad.
2	Clouds and darkness are round about him, *
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.
3	A fire goes before him *
and burns up his enemies on every side.
4	His lightnings light up the world; *
the earth sees it and is afraid.
5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, *
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
6	The heavens declare his righteousness, *
and all the peoples see his glory.
7	Confounded be all who worship carved images
and delight in false gods! *
Bow down before him, all you gods.
8	Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *
because of your judgments, O LORD.
9	For you are the LORD,
most high over all the earth; *
you are exalted far above all gods.
10	The LORD loves those who hate evil; *
he preserves the lives of his saints
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
11	Light has sprung up for the righteous, *
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.
12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *
and give thanks to his holy Name.
