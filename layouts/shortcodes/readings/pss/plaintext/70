Deus, in adjutorium
1	Be pleased, O God, to deliver me; *
O LORD, make haste to help me.
2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed
and altogether dismayed; *
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune
draw back and be disgraced.
3	Let those who say to me "Aha!" and gloat over me turn back, *
because they are ashamed.
4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; *
let those who love your salvation say for ever,
"Great is the LORD!"
5	But as for me, I am poor and needy; *
come to me speedily, O God.
6	You are my helper and my deliverer; *
O LORD, do not tarry.
