Domine, probasti
1	LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *
you know my sitting down and my rising up;
you discern my thoughts from afar.
2	You trace my journeys and my resting-places *
and are acquainted with all my ways.
3	Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.
4	You press upon me behind and before *
and lay your hand upon me.
5	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.
6	Where can I go then from your Spirit? *
where can I flee from your presence?
7	If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.
8	If I take the wings of the morning *
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
9	Even there your hand will lead me *
and your right hand hold me fast.
10	If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, *
and the light around me turn to night,"
11	Darkness is not dark to you;
the night is as bright as the day; *
darkness and light to you are both alike.
12	For you yourself created my inmost parts; *
you knit me together in my mother's womb.
13	I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.
14	My body was not hidden from you, *
while I was being made in secret
and woven in the depths of the earth.
15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;
all of them were written in your book; *
they were fashioned day by day,
when as yet there was none of them.
16	How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *
how great is the sum of them!
17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *
to count them all, my life span would need to
be like yours.
18	Oh, that you would slay the wicked, O God! *
You that thirst for blood, depart from me.
19	They speak despitefully against you; *
your enemies take your Name in vain.
20	Do I not hate those, O LORD, who hate you? *
and do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
21	I hate them with a perfect hatred; *
they have become my own enemies.
22	Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *
try me and know my restless thoughts.
23	Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.
