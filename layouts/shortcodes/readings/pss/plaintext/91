Qui habitat
1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.
2	He shall say to the LORD,
"You are my refuge and my stronghold, *
my God in whom I put my trust."
3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *
and from the deadly pestilence.
4	He shall cover you with his pinions,
and you shall find refuge under his wings; *
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.
5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *
nor of the arrow that flies by day;
6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, *
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.
7	A thousand shall fall at your side
and ten thousand at your right hand, *
but it shall not come near you.
8	Your eyes have only to behold *
to see the reward of the wicked.
9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *
and the Most High your habitation,
10	There shall no evil happen to you, *
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, *
to keep you in all your ways.
12	They shall bear you in their hands, *
lest you dash your foot against a stone.
13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.
14	Because he is bound to me in love,
therefore will I deliver him; *
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.
15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *
I am with him in trouble;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.
16	With long life will I satisfy him, *
and show him my salvation.
