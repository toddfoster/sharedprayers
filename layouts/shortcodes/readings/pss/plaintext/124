Nisi quia Dominus
1	If the LORD had not been on our side, *
let Israel now say;
2	If the LORD had not been on our side, *
when enemies rose up against us;
3	Then would they have swallowed us up alive *
in their fierce anger toward us;
4	Then would the waters have overwhelmed us *
and the torrent gone over us;
5	Then would the raging waters *
have gone right over us.
6	Blessed be the LORD! *
he has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.
7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; *
the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
8	Our help is in the Name of the LORD, *
the maker of heaven and earth.
