Part II
Tunc locutus es
19	You spoke once in vision and said to your faithful people: *
"I have set the crown upon a warrior
and have exalted one chosen out of the people.
20	I have found David my servant; *
with my holy oil have I anointed him.
21	My hand will hold him fast *
and my arm will make him strong.
22	No enemy shall deceive him, *
nor any wicked man bring him down.
23	I will crush his foes before him *
and strike down those who hate him.
24	My faithfulness and love shall be with him, *
and he shall be victorious through my Name.
25	I shall make his dominion extend *
from the Great Sea to the River.
26	He will say to me, 'You are my Father, *
my God, and the rock of my salvation.'
27	I will make him my firstborn *
and higher than the kings of the earth.
28	I will keep my love for him for ever, *
and my covenant will stand firm for him.
29	I will establish his line for ever *
and his throne as the days of heaven."
30	"If his children forsake my law *
and do not walk according to my judgments;
31	If they break my statutes *
and do not keep my commandments;
32	I will punish their transgressions with a rod *
and their iniquities with the lash;
33	But I will not take my love from him, *
nor let my faithfulness prove false.
34	I will not break my covenant, *
nor change what has gone out of my lips.
35	Once for all I have sworn by my holiness: *
'I will not lie to David.
36	His line shall endure for ever *
and his throne as the sun before me;
37	It shall stand fast for evermore like the moon, *
the abiding witness in the sky.'"
38	But you have cast off and rejected your anointed; *
you have become enraged at him.
39	You have broken your covenant with your servant, *
defiled his crown, and hurled it to the ground.
40	You have breached all his walls *
and laid his strongholds in ruins.
41	All who pass by despoil him; *
he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes *
and made all his enemies rejoice.
43	You have turned back the edge of his sword *
and have not sustained him in battle.
44	You have put an end to his splendor *
and cast his throne to the ground.
45	You have cut short the days of his youth *
and have covered him with shame.
46	How long will you hide yourself, O LORD?
will you hide yourself for ever? *
how long will your anger burn like fire?
47	Remember, LORD, how short life is, *
how frail you have made all flesh.
48	Who can live and not see death? *
who can save himself from the power of the grave?
49	Where, Lord, are your loving-kindnesses of old, *
which you promised David in your faithfulness?
50	Remember, Lord, how your servant is mocked, *
how I carry in my bosom the taunts of many peoples,
51	The taunts your enemies have hurled, O LORD, *
which they hurled at the heels of your anointed.
52	Blessed be the LORD for evermore! *
Amen, I say, Amen.
