Domine, quid multiplicati
1	LORD, how many adversaries I have! *
how many there are who rise up against me!
2	How many there are who say of me, *
"There is no help for him in his God."
3	But you, O LORD, are a shield about me; *
you are my glory, the one who lifts up my head.
4	I call aloud upon the LORD, *
and he answers me from his holy hill;
5	I lie down and go to sleep; *
I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.
6	I do not fear the multitudes of people *
who set themselves against me all around.
7	Rise up, O LORD; set me free, O my God; *
surely, you will strike all my enemies across the face,
you will break the teeth of the wicked.
8	Deliverance belongs to the LORD. *
Your blessing be upon your people!
