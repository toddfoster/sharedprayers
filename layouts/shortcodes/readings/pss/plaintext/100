Jubilate Deo
1	Be joyful in the LORD, all you lands; *
serve the LORD with gladness
and come before his presence with a song.
2	Know this: The LORD himself is God; *
he himself has made us, and we are his;
we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
3	Enter his gates with thanksgiving;
go into his courts with praise; *
give thanks to him and call upon his Name.
4	For the LORD is good;
his mercy is everlasting; *
and his faithfulness endures from age to age.
