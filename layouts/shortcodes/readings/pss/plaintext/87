Fundamenta ejus
1	On the holy mountain stands the city he has founded; *
the LORD loves the gates of Zion
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
2	Glorious things are spoken of you, *
O city of our God.
3	I count Egypt and Babylon among those who know me; *
behold Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia:
in Zion were they born.
4	Of Zion it shall be said, "Everyone was born in her, *
and the Most High himself shall sustain her."
5	The LORD will record as he enrolls the peoples, *
"These also were born there."
6	The singers and the dancers will say, *
"All my fresh springs are in you."
