Usquequo, Domine?
1	How long, O LORD?
will you forget me for ever? *
how long will you hide your face from me?
2	How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,
and grief in my heart, day after day? *
how long shall my enemy triumph over me?
3	Look upon me and answer me, O LORD my God; *
give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
4	Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," *
and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.
5	But I put my trust in your mercy; *
my heart is joyful because of your saving help.
6	I will sing to the LORD, for he has dealt with me richly; *
I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.
