Benedicam Dominum
1	I will bless the LORD at all times; *
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
2	I will glory in the LORD; *
let the humble hear and rejoice.
3	Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *
let us exalt his Name together.
4	I sought the LORD, and he answered me *
and delivered me out of all my terror.
5	Look upon him and be radiant, *
and let not your faces be ashamed.
6	I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *
and saved me from all my troubles.
7	The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *
and he will deliver them.
8	Taste and see that the LORD is good; *
happy are they who trust in him!
9	Fear the LORD, you that are his saints, *
for those who fear him lack nothing.
10	The young lions lack and suffer hunger, *
but those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is good.
11	Come, children, and listen to me; *
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
12	Who among you loves life *
and desires long life to enjoy prosperity?
13	Keep your tongue from evil-speaking *
and your lips from lying words.
14	Turn from evil and do good; *
seek peace and pursue it.
15	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, *
and his ears are open to their cry.
16	The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, *
to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.
17	The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them *
and delivers them from all their troubles.
18	The LORD is near to the brokenhearted *
and will save those whose spirits are crushed.
19	Many are the troubles of the righteous, *
but the LORD will deliver him out of them all.
20	He will keep safe all his bones; *
not one of them shall be broken.
21	Evil shall slay the wicked, *
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
22	The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, *
and none will be punished who trust in him.
