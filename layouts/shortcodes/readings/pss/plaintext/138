Confitebor tibi
1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *
before the gods I will sing your praise.
2	I will bow down toward your holy temple
and praise your Name, *
because of your love and faithfulness;
3	For you have glorified your Name *
and your word above all things.
4	When I called, you answered me; *
you increased my strength within me.
5	All the kings of the earth will praise you, O LORD, *
when they have heard the words of your mouth.
6	They will sing of the ways of the LORD, *
that great is the glory of the LORD.
7	Though the LORD be high, he cares for the lowly; *
he perceives the haughty from afar.
8	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me safe; *
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;
your right hand shall save me.
9	The LORD will make good his purpose for me; *
O LORD, your love endures for ever;
do not abandon the works of your hands.
