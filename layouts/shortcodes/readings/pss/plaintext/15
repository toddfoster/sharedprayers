Domine, quis habitabit?
1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *
who may abide upon your holy hill?
2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *
who speaks the truth from his heart.
3	There is no guile upon his tongue;
he does no evil to his friend; *
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.
4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *
but he honors those who fear the LORD.
5	He has sworn to do no wrong *
and does not take back his word.
6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.
7	Whoever does these things *
shall never be overthrown.
