Domine, refugium
1	Lord, you have been our refuge *
from one generation to another.
2	Before the mountains were brought forth,
or the land and the earth were born, *
from age to age you are God.
3	You turn us back to the dust and say, *
"Go back, O child of earth."
4	For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past *
and like a watch in the night.
5	You sweep us away like a dream; *
we fade away suddenly like the grass.
6	In the morning it is green and flourishes; *
in the evening it is dried up and withered.
7	For we consume away in your displeasure; *
we are afraid because of your wrathful indignation.
8	Our iniquities you have set before you, *
and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
9	When you are angry, all our days are gone; *
we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
10	The span of our life is seventy years,
perhaps in strength even eighty; *
yet the sum of them is but labor and sorrow,
for they pass away quickly and we are gone.
11	Who regards the power of your wrath? *
who rightly fears your indignation?
12	So teach us to number our days *
that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.
13	Return, O LORD; how long will you tarry? *
be gracious to your servants.
14	Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; *
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
15	Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us *
and the years in which we suffered adversity.
16	Show your servants your works *
and your splendor to their children.
17	May the graciousness of the LORD our God be upon us; *
prosper the work of our hands;
prosper our handiwork.
