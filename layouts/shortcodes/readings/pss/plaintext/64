Exaudi, Deus
1	Hear my voice, O God, when I complain; *
protect my life from fear of the enemy.
2	Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, *
from the mob of evildoers.
3	They sharpen their tongue like a sword, *
and aim their bitter words like arrows,
4	That they may shoot down the blameless from ambush; *
they shoot without warning and are not afraid.
5	They hold fast to their evil course; *
they plan how they may hide their snares.
6	They say, "Who will see us?
who will find out our crimes? *
we have thought out a perfect plot."
7	The human mind and heart are a mystery; *
but God will loose an arrow at them,
and suddenly they will be wounded.
8	He will make them trip over their tongues, *
and all who see them will shake their heads.
9	Everyone will stand in awe and declare God's deeds; *
they will recognize his works.
10	The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and put their trust in him, *
and all who are true of heart will glory.
