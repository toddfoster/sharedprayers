Ad Dominum
1	When I was in trouble, I called to the LORD; *
I called to the LORD, and he answered me.
2	Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips *
and from the deceitful tongue.
3	What shall be done to you, and what more besides, *
O you deceitful tongue?
4	The sharpened arrows of a warrior, *
along with hot glowing coals.
5	How hateful it is that I must lodge in Meshech *
and dwell among the tents of Kedar!
6	Too long have I had to live *
among the enemies of peace.
7	I am on the side of peace, *
but when I speak of it, they are for war.
