Omnes gentes, plaudite
1	Clap your hands, all you peoples; *
shout to God with a cry of joy.
2	For the LORD Most High is to be feared; *
he is the great King over all the earth.
3	He subdues the peoples under us, *
and the nations under our feet.
4	He chooses our inheritance for us, *
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.
5	God has gone up with a shout, *
the LORD with the sound of the ram's-horn.
6	Sing praises to God, sing praises; *
sing praises to our King, sing praises.
7	For God is King of all the earth; *
sing praises with all your skill.
8	God reigns over the nations; *
God sits upon his holy throne.
9	The nobles of the peoples have gathered together *
with the people of the God of Abraham.
10	The rulers of the earth belong to God, *
and he is highly exalted.
