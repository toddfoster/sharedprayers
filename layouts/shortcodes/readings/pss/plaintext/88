Domine, Deus
1	O LORD, my God, my Savior, *
by day and night I cry to you.
2	Let my prayer enter into your presence; *
incline your ear to my lamentation.
3	For I am full of trouble; *
my life is at the brink of the grave.
4	I am counted among those who go down to the Pit; *
I have become like one who has no strength;
5	Lost among the dead, *
like the slain who lie in the grave,
6	Whom you remember no more, *
for they are cut off from your hand.
7	You have laid me in the depths of the Pit, *
in dark places, and in the abyss.
8	Your anger weighs upon me heavily, *
and all your great waves overwhelm me.
9	You have put my friends far from me;
you have made me to be abhorred by them; *
I am in prison and cannot get free.
10	My sight has failed me because of trouble; *
LORD, I have called upon you daily;
I have stretched out my hands to you.
11	Do you work wonders for the dead? *
will those who have died stand up and give you thanks?
12	Will your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? *
your faithfulness in the land of destruction?
13	Will your wonders be known in the dark? *
or your righteousness in the country where all is forgotten?
14	But as for me, O LORD, I cry to you for help; *
in the morning my prayer comes before you.
15	LORD, why have you rejected me? *
why have you hidden your face from me?
16	Ever since my youth, I have been wretched and at the point of death; *
I have borne your terrors with a troubled mind.
17	Your blazing anger has swept over me; *
your terrors have destroyed me;
18	They surround me all day long like a flood; *
they encompass me on every side.
19	My friend and my neighbor you have put away from me, *
and darkness is my only companion.
