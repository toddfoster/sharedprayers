Part I
Confitemini Domino
1	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *
and his mercy endures for ever.
2	Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim *
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.
3	He gathered them out of the lands; *
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.
4	Some wandered in desert wastes; *
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.
5	They were hungry and thirsty; *
their spirits languished within them.
6	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *
and he delivered them from their distress.
7	He put their feet on a straight path *
to go to a city where they might dwell.
8	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy *
and the wonders he does for his children.
9	For he satisfies the thirsty *
and fills the hungry with good things.
10	Some sat in darkness and deep gloom, *
bound fast in misery and iron;
11	Because they rebelled against the words of God *
and despised the counsel of the Most High.
12	So he humbled their spirits with hard labor; *
they stumbled, and there was none to help.
13	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *
and he delivered them from their distress.
14	He led them out of darkness and deep gloom *
and broke their bonds asunder.
15	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy *
and the wonders he does for his children.
16	For he shatters the doors of bronze *
and breaks in two the iron bars.
17	Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; *
they were afflicted because of their sins.
18	They abhorred all manner of food *
and drew near to death's door.
19	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *
and he delivered them from their distress.
20	He sent forth his word and healed them *
and saved them from the grave.
21	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy *
and the wonders he does for his children.
22	Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving *
and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.
23	Some went down to the sea in ships *
and plied their trade in deep waters;
24	They beheld the works of the LORD *
and his wonders in the deep.
25	Then he spoke, and a stormy wind arose, *
which tossed high the waves of the sea.
26	They mounted up to the heavens and fell back to the depths; *
their hearts melted because of their peril.
27	They reeled and staggered like drunkards *
and were at their wits' end.
28	Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *
and he delivered them from their distress.
29	He stilled the storm to a whisper *
and quieted the waves of the sea.
30	Then were they glad because of the calm, *
and he brought them to the harbor they were bound for.
31	Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy *
and the wonders he does for his children.
32	Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people *
and praise him in the council of the elders.

Part II
Posuit flumina
33	The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *
and water-springs into thirsty ground,
34	A fruitful land into salt flats, *
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
35	He changed deserts into pools of water *
and dry land into water-springs.
36	He settled the hungry there, *
and they founded a city to dwell in.
37	They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *
and brought in a fruitful harvest.
38	He blessed them, so that they increased greatly; *
he did not let their herds decrease.
39	Yet when they were diminished and brought low, *
through stress of adversity and sorrow,
40	(He pours contempt on princes *
and makes them wander in trackless wastes)
41	He lifted up the poor out of misery *
and multiplied their families like flocks of sheep.
42	The upright will see this and rejoice, *
but all wickedness will shut its mouth.
43	Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.
