Beati omnes
1	Happy are they all who fear the LORD, *
and who follow in his ways!
2	You shall eat the fruit of your labor; *
happiness and prosperity shall be yours.
3	Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house, *
your children like olive shoots round about your table.
4	The man who fears the LORD *
shall thus indeed be blessed.
5	The LORD bless you from Zion, *
and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
6	May you live to see your children's children; *
may peace be upon Israel.
