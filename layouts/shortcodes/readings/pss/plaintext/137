Super flumina
1	By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, *
when we remembered you, O Zion.
2	As for our harps, we hung them up *
on the trees in the midst of that land.
3	For those who led us away captive asked us for a song,
and our oppressors called for mirth: *
"Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
4	How shall we sing the LORD'S song *
upon an alien soil?
5	If I forget you, O Jerusalem, *
let my right hand forget its skill.
6	Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth
if I do not remember you, *
if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy.
7	Remember the day of Jerusalem, O LORD,
against the people of Edom, *
who said, "Down with it! down with it!
even to the ground!"
8	O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, *
happy the one who pays you back
for what you have done to us!
9	Happy shall he be who takes your little ones, *
and dashes them against the rock!
