Quemadmodum
1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, *
so longs my soul for you, O God.
2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; *
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?
3	My tears have been my food day and night, *
while all day long they say to me,
Where now is your God?"
4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; *
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,
5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *
among those who keep holy-day.
6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *
and why are you so disquieted within me?
7	Put your trust in God; *
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
8	My soul is heavy within me; *
therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan,
and from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon.
9	One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; *
all your rapids and floods have gone over me.
10	The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; *
in the night season his song is with me,
a prayer to the God of my life.
11	I will say to the God of my strength,
"Why have you forgotten me? *
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy
oppresses me?"
12	While my bones are being broken, *
my enemies mock me to my face;
13	All day long they mock me *
and say to me, "Where now is your God?"
14	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *
and why are you so disquieted within me?
15	Put your trust in God; *
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
