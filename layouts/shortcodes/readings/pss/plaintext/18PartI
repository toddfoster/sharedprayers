Part I
Diligam te, Domine.
1	I love you, O LORD my strength, *
O LORD my stronghold, my crag, and my haven.
2	My God, my rock in whom I put my trust, *
my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my refuge;
you are worthy of praise.
3	I will call upon the LORD, *
and so shall I be saved from my enemies.
4	The breakers of death rolled over me, *
and the torrents of oblivion made me afraid.
5	The cords of hell entangled me, *
and the snares of death were set for me.
6	I called upon the LORD in my distress *
and cried out to my God for help.
7	He heard my voice from his heavenly dwelling; *
my cry of anguish came to his ears.
8	The earth reeled and rocked; *
the roots of the mountains shook;
they reeled because of his anger.
9	Smoke rose from his nostrils
and a consuming fire out of his mouth; *
hot burning coals blazed forth from him.
10	He parted the heavens and came down *
with a storm cloud under his feet.
11	He mounted on cherubim and flew; *
he swooped on the wings of the wind.
12	He wrapped darkness about him; *
he made dark waters and thick clouds his pavilion.
13	From the brightness of his presence, through the clouds, *
burst hailstones and coals of fire.
14	The LORD thundered out of heaven; *
the Most High uttered his voice.
15	He loosed his arrows and scattered them; *
he hurled thunderbolts and routed them.
16	The beds of the seas were uncovered,
and the foundations of the world laid bare, *
at your battle cry, O LORD,
at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
17	He reached down from on high and grasped me; *
he drew me out of great waters.
18	He delivered me from my strong enemies
and from those who hated me; *
for they were too mighty for me.
19	They confronted me in the day of my disaster; *
but the LORD was my support.
20	He brought me out into an open place; *
he rescued me because he delighted in me.
