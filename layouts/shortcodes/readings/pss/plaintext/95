Venite, exultemus
1	Come, let us sing to the LORD; *
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.
3	For the LORD is a great God, *
and a great King above all gods.
4	In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *
and the heights of the hills are his also.
5	The sea is his, for he made it, *
and his hands have molded the dry land.
6	Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.
7	For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!
8	Harden not your hearts,
as your forebears did in the wilderness, *
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,
when they tempted me.
9	They put me to the test, *
though they had seen my works.
10	Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *
"This people are wayward in their hearts;
they do not know my ways."
11	So I swore in my wrath, *
"They shall not enter into my rest."
