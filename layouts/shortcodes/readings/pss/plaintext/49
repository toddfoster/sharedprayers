Audite haec, omnes
1	Hear this, all you peoples;
hearken, all you who dwell in the world, *
you of high degree and low, rich and poor together.
2	My mouth shall speak of wisdom, *
and my heart shall meditate on understanding.
3	I will incline my ear to a proverb *
and set forth my riddle upon the harp.
4	Why should I be afraid in evil days, *
when the wickedness of those at my heels surrounds me,
5	The wickedness of those who put their trust in their goods, *
and boast of their great riches?
6	We can never ransom ourselves, *
or deliver to God the price of our life;
7	For the ransom of our life is so great, *
that we should never have enough to pay it,
8	In order to live for ever and ever, *
and never see the grave.
9	For we see that the wise die also;
like the dull and stupid they perish *
and leave their wealth to those who come after them.
10	Their graves shall be their homes for ever,
their dwelling places from generation to generation, *
though they call the lands after their own names.
11	Even though honored, they cannot live for ever; *
they are like the beasts that perish.
12	Such is the way of those who foolishly trust in themselves, *
and the end of those who delight in their own words.
13	Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die;
Death is their shepherd; *
they go down straightway to the grave.
14	Their form shall waste away, *
and the land of the dead shall be their home.
15	But God will ransom my life; *
he will snatch me from the grasp of death.
16	Do not be envious when some become rich, *
or when the grandeur of their house increases;
17	For they will carry nothing away at their death, *
nor will their grandeur follow them.
18	Though they thought highly of themselves while they lived, *
and were praised for their success,
19	They shall join the company of their forebears, *
who will never see the light again.
20	Those who are honored, but have no understanding, *
are like the beasts that perish.
