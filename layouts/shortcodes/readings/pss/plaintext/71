In te, Domine, speravi
1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; *
let me never be ashamed.
2	In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *
incline your ear to me and save me.
3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *
you are my crag and my stronghold.
4	Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.
5	For you are my hope, O LORD God, *
my confidence since I was young.
6	I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;
from my mother's womb you have been my strength; *
my praise shall be always of you.
7	I have become a portent to many; *
but you are my refuge and my strength.
8	Let my mouth be full of your praise *
and your glory all the day long.
9	Do not cast me off in my old age; *
forsake me not when my strength fails.
10	For my enemies are talking against me, *
and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.
11	They say, "God has forsaken him;
go after him and seize him; *
because there is none who will save."
12	O God, be not far from me; *
come quickly to help me, O my God.
13	Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *
let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn
and reproach.
14	But I shall always wait in patience, *
and shall praise you more and more.
15	My mouth shall recount your mighty acts
and saving deeds all day long; *
though I cannot know the number of them.
16	I will begin with the mighty works of the Lord GOD; *
I will recall your righteousness, yours alone.
17	O God, you have taught me since I was young, *
and to this day I tell of your wonderful works.
18	And now that I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not forsake me, *
till I make known your strength to this generation
and your power to all who are to come.
19	Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; *
you have done great things;
who is like you, O God?
20	You have showed me great troubles and adversities, *
but you will restore my life
and bring me up again from the deep places of the earth.
21	You strengthen me more and more; *
you enfold and comfort me,
22	Therefore I will praise you upon the lyre for your faithfulness, O my God; *
I will sing to you with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
23	My lips will sing with joy when I play to you, *
and so will my soul, which you have redeemed.
24	My tongue will proclaim your righteousness all day long, *
for they are ashamed and disgraced who sought to do me harm.
