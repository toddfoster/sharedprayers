Domine, in virtute tua
1	The king rejoices in your strength, O LORD; *
how greatly he exults in your victory!
2	You have given him his heart's desire; *
you have not denied him the request of his lips.
3	For you meet him with blessings of prosperity, *
and set a crown of fine gold upon his head.
4	He asked you for life, and you gave it to him: *
length of days, for ever and ever.
5	His honor is great, because of your victory; *
splendor and majesty have you bestowed upon him.
6	For you will give him everlasting felicity *
and will make him glad with the joy of your presence.
7	For the king puts his trust in the LORD; *
because of the loving-kindness of the Most High, he will not fall.
8	Your hand will lay hold upon all your enemies; *
your right hand will seize all those who hate you.
9	You will make them like a fiery furnace *
at the time of your appearing, O LORD;
10	You will swallow them up in your wrath, *
and fire shall consume them.
11	You will destroy their offspring from the land *
and their descendants from among the peoples of the earth.
12	Though they intend evil against you
and devise wicked schemes, *
yet they shall not prevail.
13	For you will put them to flight *
and aim your arrows at them.
14	Be exalted, O LORD, in your might; *
we will sing and praise your power.
