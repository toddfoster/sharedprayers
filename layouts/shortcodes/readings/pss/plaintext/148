Laudate Dominum
1	Hallelujah!
Praise the LORD from the heavens; *
praise him in the heights.
2	Praise him, all you angels of his; *
praise him, all his host.
3	Praise him, sun and moon; *
praise him, all you shining stars.
4	Praise him, heaven of heavens, *
and you waters above the heavens.
5	Let them praise the Name of the LORD; *
for he commanded, and they were created.
6	He made them stand fast for ever and ever; *
he gave them a law which shall not pass away.
7	Praise the LORD from the earth, *
you sea-monsters and all deeps;
8	Fire and hail, snow and fog, *
tempestuous wind, doing his will;
9	Mountains and all hills, *
fruit trees and all cedars;
10	Wild beasts and all cattle, *
creeping things and wing√®d birds;
11	Kings of the earth and all peoples, *
princes and all rulers of the world;
12	Young men and maidens, *
old and young together.
13	Let them praise the Name of the LORD, *
for his Name only is exalted,
his splendor is over earth and heaven.
14	He has raised up strength for his people
and praise for all his loyal servants, *
the children of Israel, a people who are near him.
Hallelujah!
