Laudate nomen
1	Hallelujah!
Praise the Name of the LORD; *
give praise, you servants of the LORD.
2	You who stand in the house of the LORD, *
in the courts of the house of our God.
3	Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; *
sing praises to his Name, for it is lovely.
4	For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself *
and Israel for his own possession.
5	For I know that the LORD is great, *
and that our Lord is above all gods.
6	The LORD does whatever pleases him, in heaven and on earth, *
in the seas and all the deeps.
7	He brings up rain clouds from the ends of the earth; *
he sends out lightning with the rain,
and brings the winds out of his storehouse.
8	It was he who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, *
the firstborn both of man and beast.
9	He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, *
against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10	He overthrew many nations *
and put mighty kings to death:
11	Sihon, king of the Amorites,
and Og, the king of Bashan, *
and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
12	He gave their land to be an inheritance, *
an inheritance for Israel his people.
13	O LORD, your Name is everlasting; *
your renown, O LORD, endures from age to age.
14	For the LORD gives his people justice *
and shows compassion to his servants.
15	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, *
the work of human hands.
16	They have mouths, but they cannot speak; *
eyes have they, but they cannot see.
17	They have ears, but they cannot hear; *
neither is there any breath in their mouth.
18	Those who make them are like them, *
and so are all who put their trust in them.
19	Bless the LORD, O house of Israel; *
O house of Aaron, bless the LORD.
20	Bless the LORD, O house of Levi; *
you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
21	Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, *
who dwells in Jerusalem.
Hallelujah!
