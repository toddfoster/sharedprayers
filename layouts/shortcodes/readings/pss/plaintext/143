Domine, exaudi
1	LORD, hear my prayer,
and in your faithfulness heed my supplications; *
answer me in your righteousness.
2	Enter not into judgment with your servant, *
for in your sight shall no one living be justified.
3	For my enemy has sought my life;
he has crushed me to the ground; *
he has made me live in dark places like those who
are long dead.
4	My spirit faints within me; *
my heart within me is desolate.
5	I remember the time past;
I muse upon all your deeds; *
I consider the works of your hands.
6	I spread out my hands to you; *
my soul gasps to you like a thirsty land.
7	O LORD, make haste to answer me; my spirit fails me; *
do not hide your face from me
or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit.
8	Let me hear of your loving-kindness in the morning,
for I put my trust in you; *
show me the road that I must walk,
for I lift up my soul to you.
9	Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD, *
for I flee to you for refuge.
10	Teach me to do what pleases you, for you are my God; *
let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
11	Revive me, O LORD, for your Name's sake; *
for your righteousness' sake, bring me out of trouble.
12	Of your goodness, destroy my enemies
and bring all my foes to naught, *
for truly I am your servant.
