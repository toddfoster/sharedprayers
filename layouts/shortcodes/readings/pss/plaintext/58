Si vere utique
1	Do you indeed decree righteousness, you rulers? *
do you judge the peoples with equity?
2	No; you devise evil in your hearts, *
and your hands deal out violence in the land.
3	The wicked are perverse from the womb; *
liars go astray from their birth.
4	They are as venomous as a serpent, *
they are like the deaf adder which stops its ears,
5	Which does not heed the voice of the charmer, *
no matter how skillful his charming.
6	O God, break their teeth in their mouths; *
pull the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.
7	Let them vanish like water that runs off; *
let them wither like trodden grass.
8	Let them be like the snail that melts away, *
like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.
9	Before they bear fruit, let them be cut down like a brier; *
like thorns and thistles let them be swept away.
10	The righteous will be glad when they see the vengeance; *
they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
11	And they will say,
"Surely, there is a reward for the righteous; *
surely, there is a God who rules in the earth."
