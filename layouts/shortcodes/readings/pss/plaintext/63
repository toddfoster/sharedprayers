Deus, Deus meus
1	O God, you are my God; eagerly I seek you; *
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,
as in a barren and dry land where there is no water.
2	Therefore I have gazed upon you in your holy place, *
that I might behold your power and your glory.
3	For your loving-kindness is better than life itself; *
my lips shall give you praise.
4	So will I bless you as long as I live *
and lift up my hands in your Name.
5	My soul is content, as with marrow and fatness, *
and my mouth praises you with joyful lips,
6	When I remember you upon my bed, *
and meditate on you in the night watches.
7	For you have been my helper, *
and under the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.
8	My soul clings to you; *
your right hand holds me fast.
9	May those who seek my life to destroy it *
go down into the depths of the earth;
10	Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, *
and let them be food for jackals.
11	But the king will rejoice in God;
all those who swear by him will be glad; *
for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
