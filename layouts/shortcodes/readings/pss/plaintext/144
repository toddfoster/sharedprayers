Benedictus Dominus
1	Blessed be the LORD my rock! *
who trains my hands to fight and my fingers to battle;
2	My help and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, *
my shield in whom I trust,
who subdues the peoples under me.
3	O LORD, what are we that you should care for us? *
mere mortals that you should think of us?
4	We are like a puff of wind; *
our days are like a passing shadow.
5	Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down; *
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
6	Hurl the lightning and scatter them; *
shoot out your arrows and rout them.
7	Stretch out your hand from on high; *
rescue me and deliver me from the great waters,
from the hand of foreign peoples,
8	Whose mouths speak deceitfully *
and whose right hand is raised in falsehood.
9	O God, I will sing to you a new song; *
I will play to you on a ten-stringed lyre.
10	You give victory to kings *
and have rescued David your servant.
11	Rescue me from the hurtful sword *
and deliver me from the hand of foreign peoples,
12	Whose mouths speak deceitfully *
and whose right hand is raised in falsehood.
13	May our sons be like plants well nurtured from their youth, *
and our daughters like sculptured corners of a palace.
14	May our barns be filled to overflowing with all manner of crops; *
may the flocks in our pastures increase by thousands and tens of thousands;
may our cattle be fat and sleek.
15	May there be no breaching of the walls, no going into exile, *
no wailing in the public squares.
16	Happy are the people of whom this is so! *
happy are the people whose God is the LORD!
