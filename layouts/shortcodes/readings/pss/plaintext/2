Quare fremuerunt gentes?
1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?
2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,
and the princes plot together, *
against the LORD and against his Anointed?
3	"Let us break their yoke," they say; *
"let us cast off their bonds from us."
4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *
the Lord has them in derision.
5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *
and his rage fills them with terror.
6	"I myself have set my king *
upon my holy hill of Zion."
7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: *
he said to me, "You are my Son;
this day have I begotten you.
8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for
your inheritance *
and the ends of the earth for your possession.
9	You shall crush them with an iron rod *
and shatter them like a piece of pottery."
10	And now, you kings, be wise; *
be warned, you rulers of the earth.
11	Submit to the LORD with fear, *
and with trembling bow before him;
12	Lest he be angry and you perish; *
for his wrath is quickly kindled.
13	Happy are they all *
who take refuge in him!
