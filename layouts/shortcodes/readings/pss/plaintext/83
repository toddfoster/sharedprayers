Deus, quis similis?
1	O God, do not be silent; *
do not keep still nor hold your peace, O God;
2	For your enemies are in tumult, *
and those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
3	They take secret counsel against your people *
and plot against those whom you protect.
4	They have said, "Come, let us wipe them out from among the nations; *
let the name of Israel be remembered no more."
5	They have conspired together; *
they have made an alliance against you:
6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; *
the Moabites and the Hagarenes;
7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; *
the Philistines and those who dwell in Tyre.
8	The Assyrians also have joined them, *
and have come to help the people of Lot.
9	Do to them as you did to Midian, *
to Sisera, and to Jabin at the river of Kishon:
10	They were destroyed at Endor; *
they became like dung upon the ground.
11	Make their leaders like Oreb and ZeÃ«b, *
and all their commanders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
12	Who said, "Let us take for ourselves *
the fields of God as our possession."
13	O my God, make them like whirling dust *
and like chaff before the wind;
14	Like fire that burns down a forest, *
like the flame that sets mountains ablaze.
15	Drive them with your tempest *
and terrify them with your storm;
16	Cover their faces with shame, O LORD, *
that they may seek your Name.
17	Let them be disgraced and terrified for ever; *
let them be put to confusion and perish.
18	Let them know that you, whose Name is YAHWEH, *
you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
