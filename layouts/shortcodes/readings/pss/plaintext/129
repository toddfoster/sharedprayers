SÅ“pe expugnaverunt
1	"Greatly have they oppressed me since my youth," *
let Israel now say;
2	"Greatly have they oppressed me since my youth, *
but they have not prevailed against me."
3	The plowmen plowed upon my back *
and made their furrows long.
4	The LORD, the Righteous One, *
has cut the cords of the wicked.
5	Let them be put to shame and thrown back, *
all those who are enemies of Zion.
6	Let them be like grass upon the housetops, *
which withers before it can be plucked;
7	Which does not fill the hand of the reaper, *
nor the bosom of him who binds the sheaves;
8	So that those who go by say not so much as,
"The LORD prosper you. *
We wish you well in the Name of the LORD."
