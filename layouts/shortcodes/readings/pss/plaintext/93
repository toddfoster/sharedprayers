Dominus regnavit
1	The LORD is King;
he has put on splendid apparel; *
the LORD has put on his apparel
and girded himself with strength.
2	He has made the whole world so sure *
that it cannot be moved;
3	Ever since the world began, your throne has been established; *
you are from everlasting.
4	The waters have lifted up, O LORD,
the waters have lifted up their voice; *
the waters have lifted up their pounding waves.
5	Mightier than the sound of many waters,
mightier than the breakers of the sea, *
mightier is the LORD who dwells on high.
6	Your testimonies are very sure, *
and holiness adorns your house, O LORD,
for ever and for evermore.
