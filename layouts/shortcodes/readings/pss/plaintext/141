Domine, clamavi
1	O LORD, I call to you; come to me quickly; *
hear my voice when I cry to you.
2	Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, *
the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
3	Set a watch before my mouth, O LORD,
and guard the door of my lips; *
let not my heart incline to any evil thing.
4	Let me not be occupied in wickedness with evildoers, *
nor eat of their choice foods.
5	Let the righteous smite me in friendly rebuke;
let not the oil of the unrighteous anoint my head; *
for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.
6	Let their rulers be overthrown in stony places, *
that they may know my words are true.
7	As when a plowman turns over the earth in furrows, *
let their bones be scattered at the mouth of the grave.
8	But my eyes are turned to you, Lord GOD; *
in you I take refuge;
do not strip me of my life.
9	Protect me from the snare which they have laid for me *
and from the traps of the evildoers.
10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, *
while I myself escape.
