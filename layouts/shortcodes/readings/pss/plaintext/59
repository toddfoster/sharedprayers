Eripe me de inimicis
1	Rescue me from my enemies, O God; *
protect me from those who rise up against me.
2	Rescue me from evildoers *
and save me from those who thirst for my blood.
3	See how they lie in wait for my life,
how the mighty gather together against me; *
not for any offense or fault of mine, O LORD.
4	Not because of any guilt of mine *
they run and prepare themselves for battle.
5	Rouse yourself, come to my side, and see; *
for you, LORD God of hosts, are Israel's God.
6	Awake, and punish all the ungodly; *
show no mercy to those who are faithless and evil.
7	They go to and fro in the evening; *
they snarl like dogs and run about the city.
8	Behold, they boast with their mouths,
and taunts are on their lips; *
"For who," they say, "will hear us?"
9	But you, O LORD, you laugh at them; *
you laugh all the ungodly to scorn.
10	My eyes are fixed on you, O my Strength; *
for you, O God, are my stronghold.
11	My merciful God comes to meet me; *
God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
12	Slay them, O God, lest my people forget; *
send them reeling by your might
and put them down, O Lord our shield.
13	For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips,
for the cursing and lies that they utter, *
let them be caught in their pride.
14	Make an end of them in your wrath; *
make an end of them, and they shall be no more.
15	Let everyone know that God rules in Jacob, *
and to the ends of the earth.
16	They go to and fro in the evening; *
they snarl like dogs and run about the city.
17	They forage for food, *
and if they are not filled, they howl.
18	For my part, I will sing of your strength; *
I will celebrate your love in the morning;
19	For you have become my stronghold, *
a refuge in the day of my trouble.
20	To you, O my Strength, will I sing; *
for you, O God, are my stronghold and my merciful God.
