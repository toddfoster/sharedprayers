Deus, repulisti nos
1	O God, you have cast us off and broken us; *
you have been angry;
oh, take us back to you again.
2	You have shaken the earth and split it open; *
repair the cracks in it, for it totters.
3	You have made your people know hardship; *
you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
4	You have set up a banner for those who fear you, *
to be a refuge from the power of the bow.
5	Save us by your right hand and answer us, *
that those who are dear to you may be delivered.
6	God spoke from his holy place and said: *
"I will exult and parcel out Shechem;
I will divide the valley of Succoth.
7	Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine; *
Ephraim is my helmet and Judah my scepter.
8	Moab is my wash-basin,
on Edom I throw down my sandal to claim it, *
and over Philistia will I shout in triumph."
9	Who will lead me into the strong city? *
who will bring me to Edom?
10	Have you not cast us off, O God? *
you no longer go out, O God, with our armies.
11	Grant us your help against the enemy, *
for vain is the help of man.
12	With God we will do valiant deeds, *
and he shall tread our enemies under foot.
