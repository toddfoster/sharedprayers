Qui confidunt
1	Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, *
which cannot be moved, but stands fast for ever.
2	The hills stand about Jerusalem; *
so does the LORD stand round about his people,
from this time forth for evermore.
3	The scepter of the wicked shall not hold sway over the land allotted to the just, *
so that the just shall not put their hands to evil.
4	Show your goodness, O LORD, to those who are good *
and to those who are true of heart.
5	As for those who turn aside to crooked ways,
the LORD will lead them away with the evildoers; *
but peace be upon Israel.
