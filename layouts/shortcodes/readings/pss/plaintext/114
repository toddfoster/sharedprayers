In exitu Israel
1	Hallelujah!
When Israel came out of Egypt, *
the house of Jacob from a people of strange speech,
2	Judah became God's sanctuary *
and Israel his dominion.
3	The sea beheld it and fled; *
Jordan turned and went back.
4	The mountains skipped like rams, *
and the little hills like young sheep.
5	What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? *
O Jordan, that you turned back?
6	You mountains, that you skipped like rams? *
you little hills like young sheep?
7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, *
at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8	Who turned the hard rock into a pool of water *
and flint-stone into a flowing spring.
