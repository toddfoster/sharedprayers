Paratum cor meum
1	My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; *
I will sing and make melody.
2	Wake up, my spirit;
awake, lute and harp; *
I myself will waken the dawn.
3	I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *
I will sing praises to you among the nations.
4	For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, *
and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
5	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *
and your glory over all the earth.
6	So that those who are dear to you may be delivered, *
save with your right hand and answer me.
7	God spoke from his holy place and said, *
"I will exult and parcel out Shechem;
I will divide the valley of Succoth.
8	Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine; *
Ephraim is my helmet and Judah my scepter.
9	Moab is my washbasin,
on Edom I throw down my sandal to claim it, *
and over Philistia will I shout in triumph."
10	Who will lead me into the strong city? *
who will bring me into Edom?
11	Have you not cast us off, O God? *
you no longer go out, O God, with our armies.
12	Grant us your help against the enemy, *
for vain is the help of man.
13	With God we will do valiant deeds, *
and he shall tread our enemies under foot.
