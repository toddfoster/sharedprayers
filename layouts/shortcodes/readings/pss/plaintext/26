Judica me, Domine
1	Give judgment for me, O LORD,
for I have lived with integrity; *
I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.
2	Test me, O LORD, and try me; *
examine my heart and my mind.
3	For your love is before my eyes; *
I have walked faithfully with you.
4	I have not sat with the worthless, *
nor do I consort with the deceitful.
5	I have hated the company of evildoers; *
I will not sit down with the wicked.
6	I will wash my hands in innocence, O LORD, *
that I may go in procession round your altar,
7	Singing aloud a song of thanksgiving *
and recounting all your wonderful deeds.
8	LORD, I love the house in which you dwell *
and the place where your glory abides.
9	Do not sweep me away with sinners, *
nor my life with those who thirst for blood,
10	Whose hands are full of evil plots, *
and their right hand full of bribes.
11	As for me, I will live with integrity; *
redeem me, O LORD, and have pity on me.
12	My foot stands on level ground; *
in the full assembly I will bless the LORD.
