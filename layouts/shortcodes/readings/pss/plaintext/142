Voce mea ad Dominum
1	I cry to the LORD with my voice; *
to the LORD I make loud supplication.
2	I pour out my complaint before him *
and tell him all my trouble.
3	When my spirit languishes within me, you know my path; *
in the way wherein I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
4	I look to my right hand and find no one who knows me; *
I have no place to flee to, and no one cares for me.
5	I cry out to you, O LORD; *
I say, "You are my refuge,
my portion in the land of the living."
6	Listen to my cry for help, for I have been brought very low; *
save me from those who pursue me,
for they are too strong for me.
7	Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your Name; *
when you have dealt bountifully with me,
the righteous will gather around me.
