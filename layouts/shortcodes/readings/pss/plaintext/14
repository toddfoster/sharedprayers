Dixit insipiens
1	The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;
there is none who does any good.
2	The LORD looks down from heaven upon us all, *
to see if there is any who is wise,
if there is one who seeks after God.
3	Every one has proved faithless;
all alike have turned bad; *
there is none who does good; no, not one.
4	Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers *
who eat up my people like bread
and do not call upon the LORD?
5	See how they tremble with fear, *
because God is in the company of the righteous.
6	Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, *
but the LORD is their refuge.
7	Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *
when the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,
Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.
