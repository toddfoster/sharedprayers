Dixit Dominus
1	The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, *
until I make your enemies your footstool."
2	The LORD will send the scepter of your power out of Zion, *
saying, "Rule over your enemies round about you.
3	Princely state has been yours from the day of your birth; *
in the beauty of holiness have I begotten you,
like dew from the womb of the morning."
4	The LORD has sworn and he will not recant: *
"You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."
5	The Lord who is at your right hand
will smite kings in the day of his wrath; *
he will rule over the nations.
6	He will heap high the corpses; *
he will smash heads over the wide earth.
7	He will drink from the brook beside the road; *
therefore he will lift high his head.
