Non nobis, Domine
1	Not to us, O LORD, not to us,
but to your Name give glory; *
because of your love and because of your faithfulness.
2	Why should the heathen say, *
"Where then is their God?"
3	Our God is in heaven; *
whatever he wills to do he does.
4	Their idols are silver and gold, *
the work of human hands.
5	They have mouths, but they cannot speak; *
eyes have they, but they cannot see;
6	They have ears but they cannot hear; *
noses, but they cannot smell;
7	They have hands, but they cannot feel;
feet, but they cannot walk; *
they make no sound with their throat.
8	Those who make them are like them, *
and so are all who put their trust in them.
9	O Israel, trust in the LORD; *
he is their help and their shield.
10	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; *
he is their help and their shield.
11	You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; *
he is their help and their shield.
12	The LORD has been mindful of us, and he will bless us; *
he will bless the house of Israel;
he will bless the house of Aaron;
13	He will bless those who fear the LORD, *
both small and great together.
14	May the LORD increase you more and more, *
you and your children after you.
15	May you be blessed by the LORD, *
the maker of heaven and earth.
16	The heaven of heavens is the LORD'S, *
but he entrusted the earth to its peoples.
17	The dead do not praise the LORD, *
nor all those who go down into silence;
18	But we will bless the LORD, *
from this time forth for evermore.
Hallelujah!
