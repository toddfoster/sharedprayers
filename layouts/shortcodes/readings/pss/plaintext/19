Caeli enarrant
1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *
and the firmament shows his handiwork.
2	One day tells its tale to another, *
and one night imparts knowledge to another.
3	Although they have no words or language, *
and their voices are not heard,
4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *
and their message to the ends of the world.
5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.
6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens
and runs about to the end of it again; *
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.
7	The law of the LORD is perfect
and revives the soul; *
the testimony of the LORD is sure
and gives wisdom to the innocent.
8	The statutes of the LORD are just
and rejoice the heart; *
the commandment of the LORD is clear
and gives light to the eyes.
9	The fear of the LORD is clean
and endures for ever; *
the judgments of the LORD are true
and righteous altogether.
10	More to be desired are they than gold,
more than much fine gold, *
sweeter far than honey,
than honey in the comb.
11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *
and in keeping them there is great reward.
12	Who can tell how often he offends? *
cleanse me from my secret faults.
13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;
let them not get dominion over me; *
then shall I be whole and sound,
and innocent of a great offense.
14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
be acceptable in your sight, *
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.
