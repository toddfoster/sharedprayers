LÅ“tatus sum
1	I was glad when they said to me, *
"Let us go to the house of the LORD."
2	Now our feet are standing *
within your gates, O Jerusalem.
3	Jerusalem is built as a city *
that is at unity with itself;
4	To which the tribes go up,
the tribes of the LORD, *
the assembly of Israel,
to praise the Name of the LORD.
5	For there are the thrones of judgment, *
the thrones of the house of David.
6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: *
"May they prosper who love you.
7	Peace be within your walls *
and quietness within your towers.
8	For my brethren and companions' sake, *
I pray for your prosperity.
9	Because of the house of the LORD our God, *
I will seek to do you good."
