_Caeli enarrant_

> 7	The law of the LORD is perfect
and revives the soul; \*
the testimony of the LORD is sure
and gives wisdom to the innocent.
> **8	The statutes of the LORD are just
and rejoice the heart; \*
the commandment of the LORD is clear
and gives light to the eyes.**

> 9	The fear of the LORD is clean
and endures for ever; \*
the judgments of the LORD are true
and righteous altogether.
> **10	More to be desired are they than gold,
more than much fine gold, \*
sweeter far than honey,
than honey in the comb.**

> 11	By them also is your servant enlightened, \*
and in keeping them there is great reward.
