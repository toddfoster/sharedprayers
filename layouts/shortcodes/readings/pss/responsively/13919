_Domine, probasti_

> 1	LORD, you have searched me out and known me; \*
you know my sitting down and my rising up;
you discern my thoughts from afar.
> **2	You trace my journeys and my resting-places \*
and are acquainted with all my ways.**

> 3	Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, \*
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.
> **4	You press upon me behind and before \*
and lay your hand upon me.**

> 5	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; \*
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.
> **6	Where can I go then from your Spirit? \*
where can I flee from your presence?**

> 7	If I climb up to heaven, you are there; \*
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.
> **8	If I take the wings of the morning \*
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,**

> 9	Even there your hand will lead me \*
and your right hand hold me fast.
