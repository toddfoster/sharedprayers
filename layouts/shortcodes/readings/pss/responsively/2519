_Ad te, Domine, levavi_

> 1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;  
my God, I put my trust in you; \*  
let me not be humiliated,  
nor let my enemies triumph over me.  
> **2	Let none who look to you be put to shame; \*  
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.**  
  
> 3	Show me your ways, O LORD, \*  
and teach me your paths.  
> **4	Lead me in your truth and teach me, \*  
for you are the God of my salvation;  
in you have I trusted all the day long.**  
  
> 5	Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, \*  
for they are from everlasting.  
> **6	Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; \*  
remember me according to your love  
and for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.**  
  
> 7	Gracious and upright is the LORD; \*  
therefore he teaches sinners in his way.  
> **8	He guides the humble in doing right \*  
and teaches his way to the lowly.**  
  
> 9	All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness \*  
to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
