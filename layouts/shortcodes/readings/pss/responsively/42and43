_Quemadmodum_

> 1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, \*
so longs my soul for you, O God.
> **2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; \*
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?**

> 3	My tears have been my food day and night, \*
while all day long they say to me,
Where now is your God?"
> **4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; \*
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,**

> 5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \*
among those who keep holy-day.
> **6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? \*
and why are you so disquieted within me?**

> 7	Put your trust in God; \*
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
> **8	My soul is heavy within me; \*
therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan,
and from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon.**

> 9	One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; \*
all your rapids and floods have gone over me.
> **10	The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; \*
in the night season his song is with me,
a prayer to the God of my life.**

> 11	I will say to the God of my strength,
"Why have you forgotten me? \*
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy
oppresses me?"
> **12	While my bones are being broken, \*
my enemies mock me to my face;**

> 13	All day long they mock me \*
and say to me, "Where now is your God?"
> **14	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? \*
and why are you so disquieted within me?**

> 15	Put your trust in God; \*
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.


_Judica me, Deus_

> 1	Give judgment for me, O God,
and defend my cause against an ungodly people; \*
deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.
> **2	For you are the God of my strength;
why have you put me from you? \*
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy
oppresses me?**

> 3	Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, \*
and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling;
> **4	That I may go to the altar of God,
to the God of my joy and gladness; \*
and on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.**

> 5	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? \*
and why are you so disquieted within me?
> **6	Put your trust in God; \*
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.**
