_Principes persecuti sunt_

> 161	Rulers have persecuted me without a cause, \*
but my heart stands in awe of your word.
> **162	I am as glad because of your promise \*
as one who finds great spoils.**

> 163	As for lies, I hate and abhor them, \*
but your law is my love.
> **164	Seven times a day do I praise you, \*
because of your righteous judgments.**

> 165	Great peace have they who love your law; \*
for them there is no stumbling block.
> **166	I have hoped for your salvation, O LORD, \*
and have fulfilled your commandments.**

> 167	I have kept your decrees \*
and I have loved them deeply.
> **168	I have kept your commandments and decrees, \*
for all my ways are before you.**
