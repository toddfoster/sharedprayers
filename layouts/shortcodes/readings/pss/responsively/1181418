_Confitemini Domino_

> 14	The LORD is my strength and my song, \*
and he has become my salvation.
> **15	There is a sound of exultation and victory \*
in the tents of the righteous:**

> 16	"The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! \*
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!"
> **17	I shall not die, but live, \*
and declare the works of the LORD.**

> 18	The LORD has punished me sorely, \*
but he did not hand me over to death.
