> 3	Put your trust in the LORD and do good; \*
dwell in the land and feed on its riches.
> **4	Take delight in the LORD, \*
and he shall give you your heart's desire.**

> 5	Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, \*
and he will bring it to pass.
> **6	He will make your righteousness as clear as the light \*
and your just dealing as the noonday.**

> 32	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, \*
and their tongue speaks what is right.
> **33	The law of their God is in their heart, \*
and their footsteps shall not falter.**
