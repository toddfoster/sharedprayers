_Voce mea ad Dominum_

> 11	I will remember the works of the LORD, \*
and call to mind your wonders of old time.
> **12	I will meditate on all your acts \*
and ponder your mighty deeds.**

> 13	Your way, O God, is holy; \*
who is so great a god as our God?
> **14	You are the God who works wonders \*
and have declared your power among the peoples.**

> 15	By your strength you have redeemed your people, \*
the children of Jacob and Joseph.
