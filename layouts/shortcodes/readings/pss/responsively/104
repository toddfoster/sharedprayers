_Benedic, anima mea_

> 1	Bless the LORD, O my soul; \*  
O LORD my God, how excellent is your greatness!  
you are clothed with majesty and splendor.  
> **2	You wrap yourself with light as with a cloak \*  
and spread out the heavens like a curtain.**  
  
> 3	You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters above; \*  
you make the clouds your chariot;  
you ride on the wings of the wind.  
> **4	You make the winds your messengers \*  
and flames of fire your servants.**  
  
> 5	You have set the earth upon its foundations, \*  
so that it never shall move at any time.  
> **6	You covered it with the Deep as with a mantle; \*  
the waters stood higher than the mountains.**  
  
> 7	At your rebuke they fled; \*  
at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.  
> **8	They went up into the hills and down to the valleys beneath, \*  
to the places you had appointed for them.**  
  
> 9	You set the limits that they should not pass; \*  
they shall not again cover the earth.  
> **10	You send the springs into the valleys; \*  
they flow between the mountains.**  
  
> 11	All the beasts of the field drink their fill from them, \*  
and the wild asses quench their thirst.  
> **12	Beside them the birds of the air make their nests \*  
and sing among the branches.**  
  
> 13	You water the mountains from your dwelling on high; \*  
the earth is fully satisfied by the fruit of your works.  
> **14	You make grass grow for flocks and herds \*  
and plants to serve mankind;**  
  
> 15	That they may bring forth food from the earth, \*  
and wine to gladden our hearts,  
> **16	Oil to make a cheerful countenance, \*  
and bread to strengthen the heart.**  
  
> 17	The trees of the LORD are full of sap, \*  
the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,  
> **18	In which the birds build their nests, \*  
and in whose tops the stork makes his dwelling.**  
  
> 19	The high hills are a refuge for the mountain goats, \*  
and the stony cliffs for the rock badgers.  
> **20	You appointed the moon to mark the seasons, \*  
and the sun knows the time of its setting.**  
  
> 21	You make darkness that it may be night, \*  
in which all the beasts of the forest prowl.  
> **22	The lions roar after their prey \*  
and seek their food from God.**  
  
> 23	The sun rises, and they slip away \*  
and lay themselves down in their dens.  
> **24	Man goes forth to his work \*  
and to his labor until the evening.**  
  
> 25	O LORD, how manifold are your works! \*  
in wisdom you have made them all;  
the earth is full of your creatures.  
> **26	Yonder is the great and wide sea  
with its living things too many to number, \*  
creatures both small and great.**  
  
> 27	There move the ships,  
and there is that Leviathan, \*  
which you have made for the sport of it.  
> **28	All of them look to you \*  
to give them their food in due season.**  
  
> 29	You give it to them; they gather it; \*  
you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.  
> **30	You hide your face, and they are terrified; \*  
you take away their breath,  
and they die and return to their dust.**  
  
> 31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; \*  
and so you renew the face of the earth.  
> **32	May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; \*  
may the LORD rejoice in all his works.**  
  
> 33	He looks at the earth and it trembles; \*  
he touches the mountains and they smoke.  
> **34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; \*  
I will praise my God while I have my being.**  
  
> 35	May these words of mine please him; \*  
I will rejoice in the LORD.  
> **36	Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, \*  
and the wicked be no more.**  
  
> 37	Bless the LORD, O my soul. \*  
Hallelujah!
