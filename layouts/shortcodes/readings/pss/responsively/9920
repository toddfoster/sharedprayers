_Confitebor tibi_

> 9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, \*
a refuge in time of trouble.
> **10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, \*
for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.**

> 11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; \*
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.
> **12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; \*
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.**

> 13	Have pity on me, O LORD; \*
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;
> **14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation \*
in the gates of the city of Zion.**

> 15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, \*
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.
> **16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; \*
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.**

> 17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, \*
and also all the people that forget God.
> **18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, \*
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.**

> 19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; \*
let them be judged before you.
> **20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; \*
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.**
