_Dixit injustus_

> 1	There is a voice of rebellion deep in the heart of the wicked; \*  
there is no fear of God before his eyes.  
> **2	He flatters himself in his own eyes \*  
that his hateful sin will not be found out.**  
  
> 3	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; \*  
he has left off acting wisely and doing good.  
> **4	He thinks up wickedness upon his bed  
and has set himself in no good way; \*  
he does not abhor that which is evil.**  
  
> 5	Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, \*  
and your faithfulness to the clouds.
