_Quemadmodum_

> 1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, \*
so longs my soul for you, O God.
> **2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; \*
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?**

> 3	My tears have been my food day and night, \*
while all day long they say to me,
Where now is your God?"
> **4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; \*
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,**

> 5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, \*
among those who keep holy-day.
> **6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? \*
and why are you so disquieted within me?**

> 7	Put your trust in God; \*
for I will yet give thanks to him,
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
