_Exsurgat Deus_

> 1	Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *
let those who hate him flee before him.
> **2	Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at
the presence of God.**

> 3	But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *
let them also be merry and joyful.
> **4	Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; *
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!**

> 5	Father of orphans, defender of widows, *
God in his holy habitation!
> **6	God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners
into freedom; *
but the rebels shall live in dry places.**

> 7	O God, when you went forth before your people, *
when you marched through the wilderness,
> **8	The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.**

> 9	You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *
you refreshed the land when it was weary.
> **10	Your people found their home in it; *
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision
for the poor.**

> 11	The Lord gave the word; *
great was the company of women who bore the tidings:
> **12	"Kings with their armies are fleeing away; *
the women at home are dividing the spoils."**

> 13	Though you lingered among the sheepfolds, *
you shall be like a dove whose wings are covered with silver,
whose feathers are like green gold.
> **14	When the Almighty scattered kings, *
it was like snow falling in Zalmon.**

> 15	O mighty mountain, O hill of Bashan! *
O rugged mountain, O hill of Bashan!
> **16	Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountain,
at the hill which God chose for his resting place? *
truly, the LORD will dwell there for ever.**

> 17	The chariots of God are twenty thousand,
even thousands of thousands; *
the Lord comes in holiness from Sinai.
> **18	You have gone up on high and led captivity captive;
you have received gifts even from your enemies, *
that the LORD God might dwell among them.**

> 19	Blessed be the Lord day by day, *
the God of our salvation, who bears our burdens.
> **20	He is our God, the God of our salvation; *
God is the LORD, by whom we escape death.**

> 21	God shall crush the heads of his enemies, *
and the hairy scalp of those who go on still in their
wickedness.
> **22	The Lord has said, "I will bring them back from Bashan; *
I will bring them back from the depths of the sea;**

> 23	That your foot may be dipped in blood, *
the tongues of your dogs in the blood of your enemies."
> **24	They see your procession, O God, *
your procession into the sanctuary, my God and my King.**

> 25	The singers go before, musicians follow after, *
in the midst of maidens playing upon the hand-drums.
> **26	Bless God in the congregation; *
bless the LORD, you that are of the fountain of Israel.**

> 27	There is Benjamin, least of the tribes, at the head;
the princes of Judah in a company; *
and the princes of Zebulon and Naphtali.
> **28	Send forth your strength, O God; *
establish, O God, what you have wrought for us.**

> 29	Kings shall bring gifts to you, *
for your temple's sake at Jerusalem.
> **30	Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, *
and the peoples, a herd of wild bulls with its calves.**

> 31	Trample down those who lust after silver; *
scatter the peoples that delight in war.
> **32	Let tribute be brought out of Egypt; *
let Ethiopia stretch out her hands to God.**

> 33	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; *
sing praises to the Lord.
> **34	He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; *
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.**

> 35	Ascribe power to God; *
his majesty is over Israel;
his strength is in the skies.
> **36	How wonderful is God in his holy places! *
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his people!
Blessed be God!**
