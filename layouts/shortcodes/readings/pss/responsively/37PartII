_Novit Dominus_

> 19	The LORD cares for the lives of the godly, *
and their inheritance shall last for ever.
> **20	They shall not be ashamed in bad times, *
and in days of famine they shall have enough.**

> 21	As for the wicked, they shall perish, *
and the enemies of the LORD, like the glory of
the meadows, shall vanish;
they shall vanish like smoke.
> **22	The wicked borrow and do not repay, *
but the righteous are generous in giving.**

> 23	Those who are blessed by God shall possess the land, *
but those who are cursed by him shall be destroyed.
> **24	Our steps are directed by the LORD; *
he strengthens those in whose way he delights.**

> 25	If they stumble, they shall not fall headlong, *
for the LORD holds them by the hand.
> **26	I have been young and now I am old, *
but never have I seen the righteous forsaken,
or their children begging bread.**

> 27	The righteous are always generous in their lending, *
and their children shall be a blessing.
> **28	Turn from evil, and do good, *
and dwell in the land for ever.**

> 29	For the LORD loves justice; *
he does not forsake his faithful ones.
> **30	They shall be kept safe for ever, *
but the offspring of the wicked shall be destroyed.**

> 31	The righteous shall possess the land *
and dwell in it for ever.
> **32	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, *
and their tongue speaks what is right.**

> 33	The law of their God is in their heart, *
and their footsteps shall not falter.
> **34	The wicked spy on the righteous *
and seek occasion to kill them.**

> 35	The LORD will not abandon them to their hand, *
nor let them be found guilty when brought to trial.
> **36	Wait upon the LORD and keep his way; *
he will raise you up to possess the land,
and when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.**

> 37	I have seen the wicked in their arrogance, *
flourishing like a tree in full leaf.
> **38	I went by, and behold, they were not there; *
I searched for them, but they could not be found.**

> 39	Mark those who are honest;
observe the upright; *
for there is a future for the peaceable.
> **40	Transgressors shall be destroyed, one and all; *
the future of the wicked is cut off.**

> 41	But the deliverance of the righteous comes from the LORD; *
he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
> **42	The LORD will help them and rescue them; *
he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,
because they seek refuge in him.**
