_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
let me never be put to shame; \*
deliver me in your righteousness.
> **2	Incline your ear to me; \*
make haste to deliver me.**

> 3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,
for you are my crag and my stronghold; \*
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.
> **4	Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, \*
for you are my tower of strength.**

> 5	Into your hands I commend my spirit, \*
for you have redeemed me,
O LORD, O God of truth.
