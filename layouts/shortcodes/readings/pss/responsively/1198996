**Lamedh**
_In Å“ternum, Domine_

> 89	O LORD, your word is everlasting; \*
it stands firm in the heavens.
> **90	Your faithfulness remains from one generation to another; \*
you established the earth, and it abides.**

> 91	By your decree these continue to this day, \*
for all things are your servants.
> **92	If my delight had not been in your law, \*
I should have perished in my affliction.**

> 93	I will never forget your commandments, \*
because by them you give me life.
> **94	I am yours; oh, that you would save me! \*
for I study your commandments.**

> 95	Though the wicked lie in wait for me to destroy me, \*
I will apply my mind to your decrees.
> **96	I see that all things come to an end, \*
but your commandment has no bounds.**
