_Misericordias Domini_

> 1	Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; \*  
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.  
> **2	For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; \*  
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.**  
  
> 3	"I have made a covenant with my chosen one; \*  
I have sworn an oath to David my servant:  
> **4	'I will establish your line for ever, \*  
and preserve your throne for all generations.'"**  
  
> 5	The heavens bear witness to your wonders, O LORD, \*  
and to your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones;  
> **6	For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? \*  
who is like the LORD among the gods?**  
  
> 7	God is much to be feared in the council of the holy ones, \*  
great and terrible to all those round about him.  
> **8	Who is like you, LORD God of hosts? \*  
O mighty LORD, your faithfulness is all around you.**
