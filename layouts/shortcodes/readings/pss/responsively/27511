_Dominus illuminatio_

> 5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;
one thing I seek; \*
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days
of my life;
> **6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD \*
and to seek him in his temple.**

> 7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; \*
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling
and set me high upon a rock.
> **8	Even now he lifts up my head \*
above my enemies round about me.**

> 9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation
with sounds of great gladness; \*
I will sing and make music to the LORD.
> **10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; \*
have mercy on me and answer me.**

> 11	You speak in my heart and say, "Seek my face." \*
Your face, LORD, will I seek.
