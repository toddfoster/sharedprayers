_Deus, judicium_

> 1	Give the King your justice, O God, \*  
and your righteousness to the King's son;  
> **2	That he may rule your people righteously \*  
and the poor with justice.**  
  
> 3	That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, \*  
and the little hills bring righteousness.  
> **4	He shall defend the needy among the people; \*  
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.**  
  
> 5	He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, \*  
from one generation to another.  
> **6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, \*  
like showers that water the earth.**  
  
> **7	In his time shall the righteous flourish; \*  
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.**  

> 18	Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, \*  
who alone does wondrous deeds!  
> **19	And blessed be his glorious Name for ever! \*  
and may all the earth be filled with his glory.  
Amen. Amen.**
