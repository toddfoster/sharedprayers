_Miserere mei, Deus_

> 1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; \*
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.
> **2	Wash me through and through from my wickedness \*
and cleanse me from my sin.**

> 3	For I know my transgressions, \*
and my sin is ever before me.
> **4	Against you only have I sinned \*
and done what is evil in your sight.**

> 5	And so you are justified when you speak \*
and upright in your judgment.
> **6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, \*
a sinner from my mother's womb.**

> 7	For behold, you look for truth deep within me, \*
and will make me understand wisdom secretly
> **8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; \*
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.**
