_Confitemini Domino_

> 1	Hallelujah!  
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, \*  
for his mercy endures for ever.  
> **2	Who can declare the mighty acts of the LORD \*  
or show forth all his praise?**  
  
> 3	Happy are those who act with justice \*  
and always do what is right!  
> **4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have for your people, \*  
and visit me with your saving help;**  
  
> 5	That I may see the prosperity of your elect  
and be glad with the gladness of your people, \*  
that I may glory with your inheritance.  
> **6	We have sinned as our forebears did; \*  
we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.**  
  
> 7	In Egypt they did not consider your marvelous works,  
nor remember the abundance of your love; \*  
they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.  
> **8	But he saved them for his Name's sake, \*  
to make his power known.**  
  
> 9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, \*  
and he led them through the deep as through a desert.  
> **10	He saved them from the hand of those who hated them \*  
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.**  
  
> 11	The waters covered their oppressors; \*  
not one of them was left.  
> **12	Then they believed his words \*  
and sang him songs of praise.**  
  
> 13	But they soon forgot his deeds \*  
and did not wait for his counsel.  
> **14	A craving seized them in the wilderness, \*  
and they put God to the test in the desert.**  
  
> 15	He gave them what they asked, \*  
but sent leanness into their soul.  
> **16	They envied Moses in the camp, \*  
and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.**  
  
> 17	The earth opened and swallowed Dathan \*  
and covered the company of Abiram.  
> **18	Fire blazed up against their company, \*  
and flames devoured the wicked.**

_Et fecerunt vitulum_

> 19	Israel made a bull-calf at Horeb \*  
and worshiped a molten image;  
> **20	And so they exchanged their Glory \*  
for the image of an ox that feeds on grass.**  
  
> 21	They forgot God their Savior, \*  
who had done great things in Egypt,  
> **22	Wonderful deeds in the land of Ham, \*  
and fearful things at the Red Sea.**  
  
> 23	So he would have destroyed them,  
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, \*  
to turn away his wrath from consuming them.  
> **24	They refused the pleasant land \*  
and would not believe his promise.**  
  
> 25	They grumbled in their tents \*  
and would not listen to the voice of the LORD.  
> **26	So he lifted his hand against them, \*  
to overthrow them in the wilderness,**  
  
> 27	To cast out their seed among the nations, \*  
and to scatter them throughout the lands.  
> **28	They joined themselves to Baal-Peor \*  
and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.**  
  
> 29	They provoked him to anger with their actions, \*  
and a plague broke out among them.  
> **30	Then Phinehas stood up and interceded, \*  
and the plague came to an end.**  
  
> 31	This was reckoned to him as righteousness \*  
throughout all generations for ever.  
> **32	Again they provoked his anger at the waters of Meribah, \*  
so that he punished Moses because of them;**  
  
> 33	For they so embittered his spirit \*  
that he spoke rash words with his lips.  
> **34	They did not destroy the peoples \*  
as the LORD had commanded them.**  
  
> 35	They intermingled with the heathen \*  
and learned their pagan ways,  
> **36	So that they worshiped their idols, \*  
which became a snare to them.**  
  
> 37	They sacrificed their sons \*  
and their daughters to evil spirits.  
> **38	They shed innocent blood,  
the blood of their sons and daughters, \*  
which they offered to the idols of Canaan,  
and the land was defiled with blood.**  
  
> 39	Thus they were polluted by their actions \*  
and went whoring in their evil deeds.  
> **40	Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled against his people \*  
and he abhorred his inheritance.**  
  
> 41	He gave them over to the hand of the heathen, \*  
and those who hated them ruled over them.  
> **42	Their enemies oppressed them, \*  
and they were humbled under their hand.**  
  
> 43	Many a time did he deliver them,  
but they rebelled through their own devices, \*  
and were brought down in their iniquity.  
> **44	Nevertheless, he saw their distress, \*  
when he heard their lamentation.**  
  
> 45	He remembered his covenant with them \*  
and relented in accordance with his great mercy.  
> **46	He caused them to be pitied \*  
by those who held them captive.**  
  
> 47	Save us, O LORD our God,  
and gather us from among the nations, \*  
that we may give thanks to your holy Name  
and glory in your praise.  
> **48	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,  
from everlasting to everlasting; \*  
and let all the people say, "Amen!"  
Hallelujah!**
