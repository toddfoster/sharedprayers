> 1	Hallelujah!
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *
for his mercy endures for ever.
> **2	Who can declare the mighty acts of the LORD *
or show forth all his praise?**

> 3	Happy are those who act with justice *
and always do what is right!
> **4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have
for your people, *
and visit me with your saving help;**

> 5	That I may see the prosperity of your elect
and be glad with the gladness of your people, *
that I may glory with your inheritance.
> **6	We have sinned as our forebears did; *
we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.**

> 7	In Egypt they did not consider your marvelous works,
nor remember the abundance of your love; *
they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.
> **8	But he saved them for his Name's sake, *
to make his power known.**

> 9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, *
and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
> **10	He saved them from the hand of those who hated them *
and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.**

> 11	The waters covered their oppressors; *
not one of them was left.
> **12	Then they believed his words *
and sang him songs of praise.**

> 13	But they soon forgot his deeds *
and did not wait for his counsel.
> **14	A craving seized them in the wilderness, *
and they put God to the test in the desert.**

> 15	He gave them what they asked, *
but sent leanness into their soul.
> **16	They envied Moses in the camp, *
and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.**

> 17	The earth opened and swallowed Dathan *
and covered the company of Abiram.
> **18	Fire blazed up against their company, *
and flames devoured the wicked.**
