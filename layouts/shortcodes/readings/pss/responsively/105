_Confitemini Domino_

> 1	Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; \*  
make known his deeds among the peoples.  
> **2	Sing to him, sing praises to him, \*  
and speak of all his marvelous works.**  
  
> 3	Glory in his holy Name; \*  
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.  
> **4	Search for the LORD and his strength; \*  
continually seek his face.**  
  
> 5	Remember the marvels he has done, \*  
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,  
> **6	O offspring of Abraham his servant, \*  
O children of Jacob his chosen.**  
  
> 7	He is the LORD our God; \*  
his judgments prevail in all the world.  
> **8	He has always been mindful of his covenant, \*  
the promise he made for a thousand generations:**  
  
> 9	The covenant he made with Abraham, \*  
the oath that he swore to Issac,  
> **10	Which he established as a statute for Jacob, \*  
an everlasting covenant for Israel,**  
  
> 11	Saying, "To you will I give the land of Canaan \*  
to be your allotted inheritance."  
> **12	When they were few in number, \*  
of little account, and sojourners in the land,**  
  
> 13	Wandering from nation to nation \*  
and from one kingdom to another,  
> **14	He let no one oppress them \*  
and rebuked kings for their sake,**  
  
> 15	Saying, "Do not touch my anointed \*  
and do my prophets no harm."  
> **16	Then he called for a famine in the land \*  
and destroyed the supply of bread.**  
  
> 17	He sent a man before them, \*  
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.  
> **18	They bruised his feet in fetters; \*  
his neck they put in an iron collar.**  
  
> 19	Until his prediction came to pass, \*  
the word of the LORD tested him.  
> **20	The king sent and released him; \*  
the ruler of the peoples set him free.**  
  
> 21	He set him as a master over his household, \*  
as a ruler over all his possessions,  
> **22	To instruct his princes according to his will \*  
and to teach his elders wisdom.**

_Et intravit Israel_

> 23	Israel came into Egypt, \*  
and Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham.  
> **24	The LORD made his people exceedingly fruitful; \*  
he made them stronger than their enemies;**  
  
> 25	Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, \*  
and dealt unjustly with his servants.  
> **26	He sent Moses his servant, \*  
and Aaron whom he had chosen.**  
  
> 27	They worked his signs among them, \*  
and portents in the land of Ham.  
> **28	He sent darkness, and it grew dark; \*  
but the Egyptians rebelled against his words.**  
  
> 29	He turned their waters into blood \*  
and caused their fish to die.  
> **30	Their land was overrun by frogs, \*  
in the very chambers of their kings.**  
  
> 31	He spoke, and there came swarms of insects \*  
and gnats within all their borders.  
> **32	He gave them hailstones instead of rain, \*  
and flames of fire throughout their land.**  
  
> 33	He blasted their vines and their fig trees \*  
and shattered every tree in their country.  
> **34	He spoke, and the locust came, \*  
and young locusts without number,**  
  
> 35	Which ate up all the green plants in their land \*  
and devoured the fruit of their soil.  
> **36	He struck down the firstborn of their land, \*  
the firstfruits of all their strength.**  
  
> 37	He led out his people with silver and gold; \*  
in all their tribes there was not one that stumbled.  
> **38	Egypt was glad of their going, \*  
because they were afraid of them.**  
  
> 39	He spread out a cloud for a covering \*  
and a fire to give light in the night season.  
> **40	They asked, and quails appeared, \*  
and he satisfied them with bread from heaven.**  
  
> 41	He opened the rock, and water flowed, \*  
so the river ran in the dry places.  
> **42	For God remembered his holy word \*  
and Abraham his servant.**  
  
> 43	So he led forth his people with gladness, \*  
his chosen with shouts of joy.  
> **44	He gave his people the lands of the nations, \*  
and they took the fruit of others' toil,**  
  
> 45	That they might keep his statutes \*  
and observe his laws.  
Hallelujah!
