slow to anger and of great kindness.

and his compassion is over all his works.**

> 10	All your works praise you, O LORD, \*
and your faithful servants bless you.
> **11	They make known the glory of your kingdom \*
and speak of your power;**

> 12	That the peoples may know of your power \*
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
> **13	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; \*
your dominion endures throughout all ages.**
