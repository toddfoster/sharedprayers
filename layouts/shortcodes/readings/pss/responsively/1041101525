_Benedic, anima mea_

> 1	Bless the LORD, O my soul; \*  
O LORD my God, how excellent is your greatness!  
you are clothed with majesty and splendor.  
> **10	You send the springs into the valleys; \*  
they flow between the mountains.**  
  
> 11	All the beasts of the field drink their fill from them, \*  
and the wild asses quench their thirst.  
> **12	Beside them the birds of the air make their nests \*  
and sing among the branches.**  
  
> 13	You water the mountains from your dwelling on high; \*  
the earth is fully satisfied by the fruit of your works.  
> **14	You make grass grow for flocks and herds \*  
and plants to serve mankind;**  
  
> 15	That they may bring forth food from the earth, \*  
and wine to gladden our hearts,  
> **25	O LORD, how manifold are your works! \*  
in wisdom you have made them all;  
the earth is full of your creatures.**
