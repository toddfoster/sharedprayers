_Deus, Deus meu_

> 24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; \*
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.
> 25	**The poor shall eat and be satisfied,
	and those who seek the Lord shall praise him: \*
"May your heart live for ever!"**

> 26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, \*
and all the families of the nations bow before him.
> **27	For kingship belongs to the Lord; \*
he rules over the nations.**

> 28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; \*
all who go down to the dust fall before him.
> **29	My soul shall live for him; my descendants shall serve him; \*
they shall be known as the Lordâ€™s for ever.**

> 30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn \*
the saving deeds that he has done.
