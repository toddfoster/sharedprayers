_Voce mea ad Dominum_

> 11	I will remember the works of the LORD, \*
and call to mind your wonders of old time.
> **12	I will meditate on all your acts \*
and ponder your mighty deeds.**

> 13	Your way, O God, is holy; \*
who is so great a god as our God?
> **14	You are the God who works wonders \*
and have declared your power among the peoples.**

> 15	By your strength you have redeemed your people, \*
the children of Jacob and Joseph.
> **16	The waters saw you, O God;
the waters saw you and trembled; \*
the very depths were shaken.**

> 17	The clouds poured out water;
the skies thundered; \*
your arrows flashed to and fro;
> **18	The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
your lightnings lit up the world; \*
the earth trembled and shook.**

> 19	Your way was in the sea,
and your paths in the great waters, \*
yet your footsteps were not seen.
> **20	You led your people like a flock \*
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.**
