_Deus deorum_

> 1	The LORD, the God of gods, has spoken; \*  
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.  
> **2	Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, \*  
God reveals himself in glory.**  
  
> 3	Our God will come and will not keep silence; \*  
before him there is a consuming flame,  
and round about him a raging storm.  
> **4	He calls the heavens and the earth from above \*  
to witness the judgment of his people.**  
  
> 5	"Gather before me my loyal followers, \*  
those who have made a covenant with me  
and sealed it with sacrifice."  
> **6	Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; \*  
for God himself is judge.**
