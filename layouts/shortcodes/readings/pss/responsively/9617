_Cantate Domino_

> 1	Sing to the LORD a new song; \*  
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.  
> **2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; \*  
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.**  
  
> 3	Declare his glory among the nations \*  
and his wonders among all peoples.  
> **4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; \*  
he is more to be feared than all gods.**  
  
> 5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; \*  
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.  
> **6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! \*  
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!**  
  
> 7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; \*  
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.
