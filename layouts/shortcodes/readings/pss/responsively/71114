_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; \*
let me never be ashamed.
> **2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; \*
incline your ear to me and save me.**

> 3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; \*
you are my crag and my stronghold.
> **4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, \*
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.**

> 5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, \*
my confidence since I was young.
> **6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;
from my mother's womb you have been my strength; \*
my praise shall be always of you.**

> 7 I have become a portent to many; \*
but you are my refuge and my strength.
> **8 Let my mouth be full of your praise \*
and your glory all the day long.**

> 9 Do not cast me off in my old age; \*
forsake me not when my strength fails.
> **10 For my enemies are talking against me, \*
and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.**

> 11 They say, "God has forsaken him;
go after him and seize him; \*
because there is none who will save."
> **12 O God, be not far from me; \*
come quickly to help me, O my God.**

> 13 Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; \*
let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach.
> **14 But I shall always wait in patience, \*
and shall praise you more and more.**
