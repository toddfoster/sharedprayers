_Quam bonus Israel!_

> 23	Yet I am always with you; \*  
you hold me by my right hand.  
> **24	You will guide me by your counsel, \*  
and afterwards receive me with glory.**  
  
> 25	Whom have I in heaven but you? \*  
and having you I desire nothing upon earth.  
> **26	Though my flesh and my heart should waste away, \*  
God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.**  
  
> 27	Truly, those who forsake you will perish; \*  
you destroy all who are unfaithful.  
> **28	But it is good for me to be near God; \*  
I have made the Lord GOD my refuge.**  
  
> 29	I will speak of all your works \*  
in the gates of the city of Zion.
