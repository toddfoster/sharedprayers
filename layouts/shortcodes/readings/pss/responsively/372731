_Novit Dominus_

> 27	The righteous are always generous in their lending, \*
and their children shall be a blessing.
> **28	Turn from evil, and do good, \*
and dwell in the land for ever.**

> 29	For the LORD loves justice; \*
he does not forsake his faithful ones.
> **30	They shall be kept safe for ever, \*
but the offspring of the wicked shall be destroyed.**

> 31	The righteous shall possess the land \*
and dwell in it for ever.
