**Teth**
_Bonitatem fecisti_

> 65	O LORD, you have dealt graciously with your servant, \*  
according to your word.  
> **66	Teach me discernment and knowledge, \*  
for I have believed in your commandments.**  
  
> 67	Before I was afflicted I went astray, \*  
but now I keep your word.  
> **68	You are good and you bring forth good; \*  
instruct me in your statutes.**  
  
> 69	The proud have smeared me with lies, \*  
but I will keep your commandments with my whole heart.  
> **70	Their heart is gross and fat, \*  
but my delight is in your law.**  
  
> 71	It is good for me that I have been afflicted, \*  
that I might learn your statutes.  
> **72	The law of your mouth is dearer to me \*  
than thousands in gold and silver.**
