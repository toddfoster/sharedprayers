_Et veniat super me_

> 41	Let your loving-kindness come to me, O LORD, \*  
and your salvation, according to your promise.  
> **42	Then shall I have a word for those who taunt me, \*  
because I trust in your words.**  
  
> 43	Do not take the word of truth out of my mouth, \*  
for my hope is in your judgments.  
> **44	I shall continue to keep your law; \*  
I shall keep it for ever and ever.**  
  
> 45	I will walk at liberty, \*  
because I study your commandments.  
> **46	I will tell of your decrees before kings \*  
and will not be ashamed.**  
  
> 47	I delight in your commandments, \*  
which I have always loved.  
> **48	I will lift up my hands to your commandments, \*  
and I will meditate on your statutes.**
