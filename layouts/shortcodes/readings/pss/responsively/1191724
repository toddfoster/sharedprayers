_Retribue servo tuo_

> 17	Deal bountifully with your servant, \*  
that I may live and keep your word.  
> **18	Open my eyes, that I may see \*  
the wonders of your law.**  
  
> 19	I am a stranger here on earth; \*  
do not hide your commandments from me.  
> **20	My soul is consumed at all times \*  
with longing for your judgments.**  
  
> 21	You have rebuked the insolent; \*  
cursed are they who stray from your commandments!  
> **22	Turn from me shame and rebuke, \*  
for I have kept your decrees.**  
  
> 23	Even though rulers sit and plot against me, \*  
I will meditate on your statutes.  
> **24	For your decrees are my delight, \*  
and they are my counselors.**
