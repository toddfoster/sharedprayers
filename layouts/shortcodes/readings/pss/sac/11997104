_Quomodo dilexi!_

> 97	Oh, how I love your law! \*  
> all the day long it is in my mind.  
> **98	Your commandment has made me wiser than my enemies, \*  
> and it is always with me.**  

> 99	I have more understanding than all my teachers, \*  
> for your decrees are my study.  
> **100	I am wiser than the elders, \*  
> because I observe your commandments.**  

> 101	I restrain my feet from every evil way, \*  
> that I may keep your word.  
> **102	I do not shrink from your judgments, \*  
> because you yourself have taught me.**  

> 103	How sweet are your words to my taste! \*  
> they are sweeter than honey to my mouth.  
> **104	Through your commandments I gain understanding; \*  
> therefore I hate every lying way.**
