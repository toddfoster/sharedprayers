_Tunc locutus es_

> 20	I have found David my / servant; \*
with my holy oil have I a- / nointed him.
> **21	My hand will hold him / fast \*
and my arm will make him / strong.**

> 22	No enemy shall de- / ceive him, \*
nor any wicked man bring him / down.
> **23	I will crush his foes be- / fore him \*
and strike down those who / hate him.**

> 24	My faithfulness and love shall be with / him, \*
and he shall be victorious through my / Name.
> **25	I shall make his dominion ex- / tend \*
from the Great Sea to the / River.**

> 26	He will say to me, 'You are my / Father, \*
my God, and the rock of my sal- / vation.'
> **27	I will make him my / firstborn \*
and higher than the kings of the / earth.**

> 28	I will keep my love for him for / ever, \*
and my covenant will stand firm for / him.
> **29	I will establish his line for / ever \*
and his throne as the days of / heaven."**

> 30	"If his children forsake my / law \*
and do not walk according to my / judgments;
> **31	If they break my / statutes \*
and do not keep my com- / mandments;**

> 32	I will punish their transgressions with a / rod \*
and their iniquities with the / lash;
> **33	But I will not take my love from / him, \*
nor let my faithfulness prove / false.**

> 34	I will not break my / covenant, \*
nor change what has gone out of my / lips.
> **35	Once for all I have sworn by my / holiness: \*
'I will not lie to / David.**

> 36	His line shall endure for / ever \*
and his throne as the sun be- / fore me;
> **37	It shall stand fast for evermore like the / moon, \*
the abiding witness in the / sky.'"**
