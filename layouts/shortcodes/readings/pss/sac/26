_Judica me, Domine_

> 1	Give judgment for me, O LORD,  
for I have lived with in- / tegrity; \*  
I have trusted in the Lord and have not / faltered.  
> **2	Test me, O LORD, and / try me; \*  
examine my heart and my / mind.**  
  
> 3	For your love is before my / eyes; \*  
I have walked faithfully with / you.  
> **4	I have not sat with the / worthless, \*  
nor do I consort with the de- / ceitful.**  
  
> 5	I have hated the company of evil- / doers; \*  
I will not sit down with the / wicked.  
> **6	I will wash my hands in innocence, O / LORD, \*  
that I may go in procession round your / altar,**  
  
> 7	Singing aloud a song of thanks- / giving \*  
and recounting all your wonderful / deeds.  
> **8	LORD, I love the house in which you / dwell \*  
and the place where your glory a- / bides.**  
  
> 9	Do not sweep me away with / sinners, \*  
nor my life with those who thirst for / blood,  
> **10	Whose hands are full of evil / plots, \*  
and their right hand full of / bribes.**  
  
> 11	As for me, I will live with in- / tegrity; \*  
redeem me, O LORD, and have pity on / me.  
> **12	My foot stands on level / ground; \*  
in the full assembly I will bless the / LORD.**
