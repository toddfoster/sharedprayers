_Magnus Dominus_

> 1	Great is the LORD, and highly to be / praised; \*  
in the city of our God is his holy / hill.  
> **2	Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the hill of / Zion, \*  
the very center of the world and the city of the great / King.**  
  
> 3	God is in her / citadels; \*  
he is known to be her sure / refuge.  
> **4	Behold, the kings of the earth as- / sembled \*  
and marched forward to- / gether.**  
  
> 5	They looked and were a- / stounded; \*  
they retreated and fled in / terror.  
> **6	Trembling seized them / there; \*  
they writhed like a woman in childbirth,  
like ships of the sea when the east wind / shatters them.**  
  
> 7	As we have heard, so have we seen,  
in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our / God; \*  
God has established her for / ever.  
> **8	We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O / God, \*  
in the midst of your / temple.**  
  
> 9	Your praise, like your Name, O God, reaches to the world's / end; \*  
your right hand is full of / justice.  
> **10	Let Mount Zion be glad  
and the cities of Judah re- / joice, \*  
because of your / judgments.**  
  
> 11	Make the circuit of Zion;  
walk round a- / bout her; \*  
count the number of her / towers.  
> **12	Consider well her bulwarks;  
examine her / strongholds; \*  
that you may tell those who come / after.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> 13	This God is our God for ever and / ever; \*  
he shall be our guide for ever- / more.
