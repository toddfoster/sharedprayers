> **2	For they shall soon wither like the / grass, \*  
and like the green grass fade a- / way.**  
  
> 3	Put your trust in the LORD and do / good; \*  
dwell in the land and feed on its / riches.  
> **4	Take delight in the / LORD, \*

and wait patiently for / him.  
> **8	Do not fret yourself over the one who / prospers, \*  
the one who succeeds in evil / schemes.**

> **12	But the lowly shall possess the / land; \*  
they will delight in abundance of / peace.**

he is their stronghold in time of / trouble.  
> **42	The LORD will help them and / rescue them; \*  
he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,  
because they seek refuge in / him.**
