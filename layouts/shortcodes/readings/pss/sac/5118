_Miserere mei, Deus_

> 1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving- / kindness; \*
in your great compassion blot out my of- / fenses.
> **2	Wash me through and through from my / wickedness \*
and cleanse me from my / sin.**

> 3	For I know my trans- / gressions, \*
and my sin is ever be- / fore me.
> **4	Against you only have I / sinned \*
and done what is evil in your / sight.**

> 5	And so you are justified when you / speak \*
and upright in your / judgment.
> **6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my / birth, \*
a sinner from my mother's / womb.**

> 7	For behold, you look for truth deep with- / in me, \*
and will make me understand wisdom / secretly
> **8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be / pure; \*
wash me, and I shall be clean in- / deed.**
