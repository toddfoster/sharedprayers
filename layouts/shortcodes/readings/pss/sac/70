_Deus, in adjutorium_

> 1	Be pleased, O God, to de- / liver me; \*  
O LORD, make haste to / help me.  
> **2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed  
and altogether dis- / mayed; \*  
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune  
draw back and be dis- / graced.**  
  
> 3	Let those who say to me "Aha!" and gloat over me turn / back, \*  
because they are a- / shamed.  
> **4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be / glad in you; \*  
let those who love your salvation say for ever,  
"Great is the / LORD!"**  
  
> 5	But as for me, I am poor and / needy; \*  
come to me speedily, O / God.  
> **6	You are my helper and my de- / liverer; \*  
O LORD, do not / tarry.**
