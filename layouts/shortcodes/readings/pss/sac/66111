_Jubilate Deo_

> 1	Be joyful in God, all you / lands; \*  
sing the glory of his Name;  
sing the glory of his / praise.  
> **2	Say to God, "How awesome are your / deeds! \*  
because of your great strength your enemies cringe be- / fore you.**  
  
> 3	All the earth bows down be- / fore you, \*  
sings to you, sings out your / Name."  
> **4	Come now and see the works of / God, \*  
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all / people.**  
  
> 5	He turned the sea into dry land,  
so that they went through the water on / foot, \*  
and there we re- / joiced in him.  
> **6	In his might he rules for ever;  
his eyes keep watch over the / nations; \*  
let no rebel rise up a- / gainst him.**  
  
> 7	Bless our God, you / peoples; \*  
make the voice of his praise to be / heard;  
> **8	Who holds our souls in / life, \*  
and will not allow our feet to / slip.**  
  
> 9	For you, O God, have / proved us; \*  
you have tried us just as silver is / tried.  
> **10	You brought us into the / snare; \*  
you laid heavy burdens upon our / backs.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> **11	You let enemies ride over our heads;  
we went through fire and / water; \*  
but you brought us out into a place of re- / freshment.**
