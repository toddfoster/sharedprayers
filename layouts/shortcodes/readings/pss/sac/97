Bow down before him, all you / gods.

because of your judgments, O / LORD.**  
  
> 9	For you are the LORD,  
most high over all the / earth; \*  
you are exalted far above all / gods.  
> **10	The LORD loves those who hate / evil; \*  
he preserves the lives of his saints  
and delivers them from the hand of the / wicked.**  
  
> 11	Light has sprung up for the / righteous, \*  
and joyful gladness for those who are true- / hearted.
