or show forth all his / praise?**  
  
> 3	Happy are those who act with / justice \*  
and always do what is / right!  
> **4	Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have for your / people, \*  
and visit me with your saving / help;**  
  
> 5	That I may see the prosperity of your elect  
and be glad with the gladness of / your people, \*  
that I may glory with your in- / heritance.

**Part II**
_Et fecerunt vitulum_

> 19	Israel made a bull-calf at / Horeb \*  
and worshiped a molten / image;  
> **20	And so they exchanged their / Glory \*  
for the image of an ox that feeds on / grass.**  
  
> 21	They forgot God their / Savior, \*  
who had done great things in / Egypt,  
> **22	Wonderful deeds in the land of / Ham, \*  
and fearful things at the Red / Sea.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> **23	So he would have destroyed them,  
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the / breach, \*  
to turn away his wrath from con- / suming them.**
