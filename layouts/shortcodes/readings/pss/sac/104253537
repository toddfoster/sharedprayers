_Benedic, anima mea_

> 25	O LORD, how manifold are your / works! \*
in wisdom you have made them all;
the earth is full of your / creatures.
> **26	Yonder is the great and wide sea
with its living things too many to / number, \*
creatures both small and / great.**

> 27	There move the ships,
and there is that Lev- / iathan, \*
which you have made for the / sport of it.
> **28	All of them look to / you \*
to give them their food in due / season.**

> 29	You give it to them; they / gather it; \*
you open your hand, and they are filled with good / things.
> **30	You hide your face, and they are / terrified; \*
you take away their breath,
and they die and return to their / dust.**

> 31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are cre- / ated; \*
and so you renew the face of the / earth.
> **32	May the glory of the LORD endure for / ever; \*
may the LORD rejoice in all his / works.**

> 33	He looks at the earth and it / trembles; \*
he touches the mountains and they / smoke.
> **34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I / live; \*
I will praise my God while I have my / being.**

> 35	May these words of mine / please him; \*
I will rejoice in the / LORD.
> 37	**Bless the LORD, O my / soul. \*
Halle- / lujah!**
