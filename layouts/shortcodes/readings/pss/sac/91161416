_Qui habitat_

> 1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most / High, \*  
abides under the shadow of the Al- / mighty.  
> **2	He shall say to the LORD,  
"You are my refuge and my / stronghold, \*  
my God in whom I put my / trust."**  
  
> 3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the / hunter \*  
and from the deadly / pestilence.  
> **4	He shall cover you with his pinions,  
and you shall find refuge under his / wings; \*  
his faithfulness shall be a shield and / buckler.**  
  
> 5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by / night, \*  
nor of the arrow that flies by / day;  
> **6	Of the plague that stalks in the / darkness, \*  
nor of the sickness that lays waste at / mid-day.**  
  
> 14	Because he is bound to me in love,  
therefore will I de- / liver him; \*  
I will protect him, because he knows my / Name.  
> **15	He shall call upon me, and I will / answer him; \*  
I am with him in trouble;  
I will rescue him and bring him to / honor.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> 16	With long life will I / satisfy him, \*  
and show him my sal- / vation.
