_Domine, probasti_

> 1	LORD, you have searched me out and / known me; \*  
you know my sitting down and my rising up;  
you discern my thoughts from a- / far.  
> **2	You trace my journeys and my / resting-places \*  
and are acquainted with all my / ways.**  
  
> 3	Indeed, there is not a word on my / lips, \*  
but you, O LORD, know it alto- / gether.  
> **4	You press upon me behind and be- / fore \*  
and lay your hand up- / on me.**  
  
> 5	Such knowledge is too / wonderful for me; \*  
it is so high that I cannot at- / tain to it.  
> **12	For you yourself created my inmost / parts; \*  
you knit me together in my mother's / womb.**  
  
> 13	I will thank you because I am marvelously / made; \*  
your works are wonderful, and I know it / well.  
> **14	My body was not hidden from / you, \*  
while I was being made in secret  
and woven in the depths of the / earth.**  
  
> 15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;  
all of them were written in your / book; \*  
they were fashioned day by day,  
when as yet there was / none of them.  
> **16	How deep I find your thoughts, O / God! \*  
how great is the / sum of them!**  
  
> 17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the / sand; \*  
to count them all, my life span would need to  
be like / yours.
