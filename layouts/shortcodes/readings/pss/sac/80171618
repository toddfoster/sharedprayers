_Qui regis Israel_

> 1	Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a / flock; \*  
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the / cherubim.  
> **2	In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Ma- / nasseh, \*  
stir up your strength and come to / help us.**  
  
> 3	Restore us, O God of / hosts; \*  
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be / saved.  
> **4	O LORD God of / hosts, \*  
how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your / people?**  
  
> 5	You have fed them with the bread of / tears; \*  
you have given them bowls of tears to / drink.  
> **6	You have made us the derision of our / neighbors, \*  
and our enemies laugh us to / scorn.**  
  
> 7	Restore us, O God of / hosts; \*  
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be / saved.  
> **16	Let your hand be upon the man of your / right hand, \*  
and son of man you have made so strong for your- / self.**  
  
> 17	And so will we never turn a- / way from you; \*  
give us life, that we may call upon your / Name.  
> **18	Restore us, O LORD God of / hosts; \*  
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be / saved.**
