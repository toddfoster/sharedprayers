and binds up their / wounds.  
> **4	He counts the number of the / stars \*  
and calls them all by their / names.**  
  
> 5	Great is our LORD and mighty in / power; \*  
there is no limit to his / wisdom.  
> **6	The LORD lifts up the / lowly, \*  
but casts the wicked to the / ground.**  
  
> 7	Sing to the LORD with thanks- / giving; \*  
make music to our God upon the / harp.  
> **8	He covers the heavens with / clouds \*  
and prepares rain for the / earth;**  
  
> 9	He makes grass to grow upon the / mountains \*  
and green plants to serve man- / kind.  
> **10	He provides food for flocks and / herds \*  
and for the young ravens when they / cry.**  
  
> 11	He is not impressed by the might of a / horse; \*

> **12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who / fear him, \*  
in those who await his gracious / favor.**  
  
> 13	Worship the LORD, O Je- / rusalem; \*  
praise your God, O / Zion;

he has blessed your children with- / in you.**  
  
> 15	He has established peace on your / borders; \*  
he satisfies you with the finest / wheat.  
> **16	He sends out his command to the / earth, \*  
and his word runs very / swiftly.**  
  
> 17	He gives snow like / wool; \*  
he scatters hoarfrost like / ashes.  
> **18	He scatters his hail like / bread crumbs; \*  
who can stand against his / cold?**  
  
> 19	He sends forth his word and / melts them; \*  
he blows with his wind, and the waters / flow.  
> **20	He declares his word to / Jacob, \*  
his statutes and his judgments to / Israel.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> **21	He has not done so to any other / nation; \*  
to them he has not revealed his judgments.  
Halle- / lujah!**
