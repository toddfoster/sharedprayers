_Qui confidunt_

> 1	Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount / Zion, \*  
which cannot be moved, but stands fast for / ever.  
> **2	The hills stand about Je- / rusalem; \*  
so does the LORD stand round about his people,  
from this time forth for ever- / more.**  
  
> 3	The scepter of the wicked shall not hold sway over the land allotted to the / just, \*  
so that the just shall not put their hands to / evil.  
> **4	Show your goodness, O LORD, to those who are / good \*  
and to those who are true of / heart.**  
  
##### _Last half of tone:_
> 5	As for those who turn aside to crooked ways,  
the LORD will lead them away with the evil- / doers; \*  
but peace be upon / Israel.
