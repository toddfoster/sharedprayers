and their voices are not / heard,  
> **4	Their sound has gone out into / all lands, \*  
and their message to the ends of the / world.**  
  
> 5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the / sun; \*  
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;  
it rejoices like a champion to run its / course.  
> **6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens  
and runs about to the end of it a- / gain; \*  
nothing is hidden from its burning / heat.**

the testimony of the LORD is sure  
and gives wisdom to the / innocent.

and rejoice the / heart; \*  
the commandment of the LORD is clear  
and gives light to the / eyes.**

then shall I be whole and sound,  
and innocent of a great of- / fense.  
> **14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  
be acceptable in your / sight, \*  
O LORD, my strength and my re- / deemer.**
