_Deus, Deus meu_

> 24	My praise is of him in the great as- / sembly; \*  
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who / worship him.  
> **25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,  
and those who seek the LORD shall / praise him: \*  
"May your heart live for / ever!"**  
  
> 26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the / LORD, \*  
and all the families of the nations bow be- / fore him.  
> **27	For kingship belongs to the / LORD; \*  
he rules over the / nations.**  
  
> 28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in / worship; \*  
all who go down to the dust fall be- / fore him.  
> **29	My soul shall live for him;  
my descendants shall / serve him; \*  
they shall be known as the LORD'S for / ever.**  
  
> **30	They shall come and make known to a people / yet unborn \*  
the saving deeds that he has / done.**
