_Deus deorum_

> 1	The LORD, the God of gods, has / spoken; \*  
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its / setting.  
> **2	Out of Zion, perfect in its / beauty, \*  
God reveals himself in / glory.**  
  
> 3	Our God will come and will not keep / silence; \*  
before him there is a consuming flame,  
and round about him a raging / storm.  
> **4	He calls the heavens and the earth from a- / bove \*  
to witness the judgment of his / people.**  
  
> 5	"Gather before me my loyal / followers, \*  
those who have made a covenant with me  
and sealed it with / sacrifice."  
> **6	Let the heavens declare the rightness of his / cause; \*  
for God himself is / judge.**  
  
> 7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak:  
"O Israel, I will bear witness a- / gainst you; \*  
for I am God, your / God.  
> **8	I do not accuse you because of your / sacrifices; \*  
your offerings are always be- / fore me.**  
  
> 23	Consider this well, you who forget / God, \*  
lest I rend you and there be none to de- / liver you.  
> **24	Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving honors / me; \*  
but to those who keep in my way will I show the salvation of / God."**
