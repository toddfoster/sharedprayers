_Expectans, expectavi_

> 1	I waited patiently upon the / LORD; \*  
he stooped to me and heard my / cry.  
> **2	He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and / clay; \*  
he set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing / sure.**  
  
> 3	He put a new song in my mouth,  
a song of praise to our / God; \*  
many shall see, and stand in awe,  
and put their trust in the / LORD.  
> **4	Happy are they who trust in the / LORD! \*  
they do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false / gods.**  
  
> 5	Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God!  
how great your wonders and your / plans for us! \*  
there is none who can be compared with / you.  
> **6	Oh, that I could make them known and / tell them! \*  
but they are more than I can / count.**  
  
> 7	In sacrifice and offering you take no / pleasure \*  
(you have given me ears to / hear you);  
> **8	Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not re- / quired, \*  
and so I said, "Behold, I / come.**  
  
> 9	In the roll of the book it is written con- / cerning me: \*  
'I love to do your will, O my God;  
your law is deep in my / heart.'"  
> **10	I proclaimed righteousness in the great congre- / gation; \*  
behold, I did not restrain my lips;  
and that, O LORD, you / know.**  
  
> 11	Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart;  
I have spoken of your faithfulness and your de- / liverance; \*  
I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the  
great congre- / gation.  
> **12	You are the LORD;  
do not withhold your compassion / from me; \*  
let your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for / ever,**
