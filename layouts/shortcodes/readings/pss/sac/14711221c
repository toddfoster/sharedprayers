_Laudate Dominum_

> 1	Hallelujah!  
How good it is to sing praises to our / God! \*  
how pleasant it is to honor him with / praise!  
> **2	The LORD rebuilds Je- / rusalem; \*  
he gathers the exiles of / Israel.**  
  
> 3	He heals the broken- / hearted \*  
and binds up their / wounds.  
> **4	He counts the number of the / stars \*  
and calls them all by their / names.**  
  
> 5	Great is our LORD and mighty in / power; \*  
there is no limit to his / wisdom.  
> **6	The LORD lifts up the / lowly, \*  
but casts the wicked to the / ground.**  
  
> 7	Sing to the LORD with / thanksgiving; \*  
make music to our God upon the / harp.  
> **8	He covers the heavens with / clouds \*  
and prepares rain for the / earth;**  
  
> 9	He makes grass to grow upon the / mountains \*  
and green plants to serve man- / kind.  
> **10	He provides food for flocks and / herds \*  
and for the young ravens when they / cry.**  
  
> 11	He is not impressed by the might of a / horse; \*  
he has no pleasure in the strength of a / man;  
> **12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who / fear him, \*  
in those who await his gracious favor. Halle- / lujah!**
