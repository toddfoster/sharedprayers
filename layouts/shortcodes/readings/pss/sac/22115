_Deus, Deus meu_

> 1	My God, my God, why have you for- / saken me? \*
and are so far from my cry
and from the words of my dis- / tress?
> **2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not / answer; \*
by night as well, but I find no / rest.**

> 3	Yet you are the / Holy One, \*
enthroned upon the praises of / Israel.
> **4	Our forefathers put their trust in / you; \*
they trusted, and you delivered / them.**

> 5	They cried out to you and were de- / livered; \*
they trusted in you and were not put to / shame.
> **6	But as for me, I am a worm and no / man, \*
scorned by all and despised by the / people.**

> 7	All who see me laugh me to / scorn; \*
they curl their lips and wag their heads, / saying,
> **8	"He trusted in the LORD; let him de- / liver him; \*
let him rescue him, if he delights in / him."**

> 9	Yet you are he who took me out of the / womb, \*
and kept me safe upon my mother's / breast.
> **10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was / born; \*
you were my God when I was still in my mother's / womb.**

> 11	Be not far from me, for trouble is / near, \*
and there is none to / help.
> **12	Many young bulls en- / circle me; \*
strong bulls of Bashan sur- / round me.**

> 13	They open wide their / jaws at me, \*
like a ravening and a roaring / lion.
> **14	I am poured out like water;
all my bones are out of / joint; \*
my heart within my breast is melting / wax.**

##### Last half of tone:
> 15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my / mouth; \*
and you have laid me in the dust of the / grave.
