> Thus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped 
> to subdue nations before him and strip kings of their robes, 
> to open doors before him-- and the gates shall not be closed: 
> I will go before you and level the mountains, 
> I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron, 
> I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches hidden in secret places, 
> so that you may know that it is I, the LORD, the God of Israel, who call you by your name. 
> For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, 
> I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. 
> I am the LORD, and there is no other; besides me there is no god. I arm you, though you do not know me, 
> so that they may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is no one besides me; I am the LORD, and there is no other. 
> I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe; I the LORD do all these things.
