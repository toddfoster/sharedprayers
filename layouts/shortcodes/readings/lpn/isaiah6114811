> The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; 
> he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, 
> to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; 
> to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; 
> to provide for those who mourn in Zionâ€” to give them a garland instead of ashes, 
> the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. 
> They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.
> They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations;
> they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations. 
> For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing; 
> I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. 
> Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; 
> all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed. 
> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God; 
> for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, 
> as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 
> For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up, 
> so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
