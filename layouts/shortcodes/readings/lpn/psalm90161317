_Domine, refugium_

> 1 Lord, you have been our refuge \*  
from one generation to another.  
> **2 Before the mountains were brought forth,
or the land and the earth were born, \*  
from age to age you are God.**
  
> 3 You turn us back to the dust and say, \*  
"Go back, O child of earth."  
> **4 For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past \*  
and like a watch in the night.**
  
> 5 You sweep us away like a dream; \*  
we fade away suddenly like the grass.  
> **6 In the morning it is green and flourishes; \*  
in the evening it is dried up and withered.**
  
> 13 Return, O LORD; how long will you tarry? \*  
be gracious to your servants.  
> **14 Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; \*  
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.**
  
> 15 Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us \*  
and the years in which we suffered adversity.  
> **16 Show your servants your works \*  
and your splendor to their children.**
  
> 17 May the graciousness of the LORD our God be upon us; \*  
prosper the work of our hands;
prosper our handiwork.
