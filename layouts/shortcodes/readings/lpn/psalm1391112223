_Domine, probasti_

> 1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; \*  
you know my sitting down and my rising up;
you discern my thoughts from afar.  
> **2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places \*  
and are acquainted with all my ways.**
  
> 3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, \*  
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.  
> **4 You press upon me behind and before \*  
and lay your hand upon me.**
  
> 5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; \*  
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.  
> **6 Where can I go then from your Spirit? \*  
where can I flee from your presence?**
  
> 7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; \*  
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.  
> **8 If I take the wings of the morning \*  
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,**
  
> 9 Even there your hand will lead me \*  
and your right hand hold me fast.  
> **10 If I say, "Surely the darkness will cover me, \*  
and the light around me turn to night,"**
  
> 11 Darkness is not dark to you;
the night is as bright as the day; \*  
darkness and light to you are both alike.  
> **22 Search me out, O God, and know my heart; \*  
try me and know my restless thoughts.**
  
> 23 Look well whether there be any wickedness in me \*  
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.
