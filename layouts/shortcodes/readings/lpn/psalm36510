_Dixit injustus_

> 5  Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, \*  
      and your faithfulness to the clouds.  
> **6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,
        your justice like the great deep; \*  
        you save both man and beast, O LORD.**
  
> 7 How priceless is your love, O God! \*  
        your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.  
> **8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; \*  
        you give them drink from the river of your delights.**
  
> 9 For with you is the well of life, \*  
        and in your light we see light.  
> **10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, \*  
        and your favor to those who are true of heart.**
