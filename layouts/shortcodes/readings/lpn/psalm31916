_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 9
          Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; \*  
    my eye is consumed with sorrow,
    and also my throat and my belly.  
> **10
    For my life is wasted with grief,
    and my years with sighing; \*  
    my strength fails me because of affliction,
    and my bones are consumed.**
  
> 11
    I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors,
    a dismay to those of my acquaintance; \*  
    when they see me in the street they avoid me.  
> **12
    I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; \*  
    I am as useless as a broken pot.**
  
> 13
    For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;
    fear is all around; \*  
    they put their heads together against me;
    they plot to take my life.  
> **14
    But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. \*  
    I have said, "You are my God.**
  
> 15
    My times are in your hand; \*  
    rescue me from the hand of my enemies,
    and from those who persecute me.  
> **16
    Make your face to shine upon your servant, \*  
    and in your loving-kindness save me."**
