_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1 In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
 let me never be put to shame; \*  
 deliver me in your righteousness.  
> **2 Incline your ear to me; \*  
 make haste to deliver me.**
  
> 3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,
 for you are my crag and my stronghold; \*  
 for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.  
> **4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, \*  
 for you are my tower of strength.**
  
> 5 Into your hands I commend my spirit, \*  
 for you have redeemed me,
 O LORD, O God of truth.  
> **19 How great is your goodness, O LORD!
 which you have laid up for those who fear you; \*  
 which you have done in the sight of all
 for those who put their trust in you.**
  
> 20 You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who slander them; \*  
 you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.  
> **21 Blessed be the LORD! \*  
 for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged city.**
  
> 22 Yet I said in my alarm,
 "I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes." \*  
 Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty
 when I cried out to you.  
> **23 Love the LORD, all you who worship him; \*  
 the LORD protects the faithful,
 but repays to the full those who act haughtily.**
  
> 24 Be strong and let your heart take courage, \*  
 all you who wait for the LORD.
