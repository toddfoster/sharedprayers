Job said,

> "O that my words were written down! O that they were inscribed in a book! 
> O that with an iron pen and with lead they were engraved on a rock forever! 
> For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that at the last he will stand upon the earth; 
> and after my skin has been thus destroyed, then in my flesh I shall see God, 
> whom I shall see on my side, and my eyes shall behold, and not another."
