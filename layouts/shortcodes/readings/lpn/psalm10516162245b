_Confitemini Domino_

> 1 Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; \*  
make known his deeds among the peoples.  
> **2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, \*  
and speak of all his marvelous works.**
  
> 3 Glory in his holy Name; \*  
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.  
> **4 Search for the LORD and his strength; \*  
continually seek his face.**
  
> 5 Remember the marvels he has done, \*  
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,  
> **6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, \*  
O children of Jacob his chosen.**
  
> 16 Then he called for a famine in the land \*  
and destroyed the supply of bread.  
> **17 He sent a man before them, \*  
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.**
  
> 18 They bruised his feet in fetters; \*  
his neck they put in an iron collar.  
> **19 Until his prediction came to pass, \*  
the word of the LORD tested him.**
  
> 20 The king sent and released him; \*  
the ruler of the peoples set him free.  
> **21 He set him as a master over his household,
as a ruler over all his possessions,**
  
> 22 To instruct his princes according to his will
and to teach his elders wisdom.  
> **45 Hallelujah!**
