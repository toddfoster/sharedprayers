_Confitemini Domino_

> 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
> **2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**
  
> 3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.  
> **17 Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; \*  
they were afflicted because of their sins.**
  
> 18 They abhorred all manner of food \*  
and drew near to death's door.  
> **19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.**
  
> 20 He sent forth his word and healed them \*  
and saved them from the grave.  
> **21 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy \*  
and the wonders he does for his children.**
  
> 22 Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving \*  
and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.
