_Exultate, justi_

> 12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! \*   
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!  
> **13 The LORD looks down from heaven, \*   
and beholds all the people in the world.**
  
> 14 From where he sits enthroned he turns his gaze \*   
on all who dwell on the earth.  
> **15 He fashions all the hearts of them \*   
and understands all their works.**
  
> 16 There is no king that can be saved by a mighty army; \*   
a strong man is not delivered by his great strength.  
> **17 The horse is a vain hope for deliverance; \*   
for all its strength it cannot save.**
  
> 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, \*   
on those who wait upon his love,  
> **19 To pluck their lives from death, \*   
and to feed them in time of famine.**
  
> 20 Our soul waits for the LORD; \*   
he is our help and our shield.  
> **21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, \*   
for in his holy Name we put our trust.**
  
> 22 Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \*   
as we have put our trust in you.
