> Thus says the Lord:
> "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; 
> and you that have no money, come, buy and eat! 
> Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
> Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? 
> Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food. 
> Incline your ear, and come to me; listen, so that you may live. 
> I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David. 
> See, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples. 
> See, you shall call nations that you do not know, and nations that do not know you shall run to you, 
> because of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you."
