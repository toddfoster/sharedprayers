_Caeli enarrant_

> 7 The law of the LORD is perfect
and revives the soul; \*  
 the testimony of the LORD is sure
and gives wisdom to the innocent.  
> **8 The statutes of the LORD are just
 and rejoice the heart; \*  
 the commandment of the LORD is clear
 and gives light to the eyes.**
  
> 9 The fear of the LORD is clean
 and endures for ever; \*  
 the judgments of the LORD are true
 and righteous altogether.  
> **10 More to be desired are they than gold,
 more than much fine gold, \*  
 sweeter far than honey,
 than honey in the comb.**
  
> 11 By them also is your servant enlightened, \*  
 and in keeping them there is great reward.  
> **12 Who can tell how often he offends? \*  
 cleanse me from my secret faults.**
  
> 13 Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;
 let them not get dominion over me; \*  
 then shall I be whole and sound,
 and innocent of a great offense.  
> **14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my
 heart be acceptable in your sight, \*  
 O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.**
