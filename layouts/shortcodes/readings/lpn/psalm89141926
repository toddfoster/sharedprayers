_Misericordias Domini_

> 1 Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; \*  
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.  
> **2 For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; \*  
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.**
  
> 3 “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; \*  
 I have sworn an oath to David my servant:  
> **4 ‘I will establish your line for ever, \*  
and preserve your throne for all generations.’”**
  
> 19 You spoke once in a vision and said to your faithful people: \*  
“I have set the crown upon a warrior
 and have exalted one chosen out of the people.  
> **20 I have found David my servant; \*  
with my holy oil have I anointed him.**
  
> 21 My hand will hold him fast \*  
and my arm will make him strong.  
> **22 No enemy shall deceive him, \*  
nor any wicked man bring him down.**
  
> 23 I will crush his foes before him \*  
and strike down those who hate him.  
> **24 My faithfulness and love shall be with him, \*  
and he shall be victorious through my Name.**
  
> 25 I shall make his dominion extend \*  
from the Great Sea to the River.  
> **26 He will say to me, ‘You are my Father, \*  
my God, and the rock of my salvation.’”**
