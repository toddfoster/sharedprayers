> How lonely sits the city that once was full of people! 
> How like a widow she has become, she that was great among the nations! 
> She that was a princess among the provinces has become a vassal. 
> She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks;
> among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her; 
> all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.
> Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude; 
> she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place;
> her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress. 
> The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals;
> all her gates are desolate, her priests groan;
> her young girls grieve, and her lot is bitter.
> Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper, 
> because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions;
> her children have gone away, captives before the foe.
> From daughter Zion has departed all her majesty.
> Her princes have become like stags that find no pasture; 
> they fled without strength before the pursuer.
