> Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem! 
> Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, 
> humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. 
> He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; 
> and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; 
> his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
> As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. 
> Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
