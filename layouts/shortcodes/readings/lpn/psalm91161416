_Qui habitat_

> 1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, \*  
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.  
> **2 He shall say to the LORD,
"You are my refuge and my stronghold, \*  
 my God in whom I put my trust."**
  
> 3 He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter \*  
and from the deadly pestilence.  
> **4 He shall cover you with his pinions,
and you shall find refuge under his wings; \*  
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.**
  
> 5 You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, \*  
nor of the arrow that flies by day;  
> **6 Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, \*  
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.**
  
> 14 Because he is bound to me in love,
therefore will I deliver him; \*  
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.  
> **15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; \*  
I am with him in trouble;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.**
  
> 16 With long life will I satisfy him, \*  
and show him my salvation.
