_Eructavit cor meum_

> 1 My heart is stirring with a noble song; 
let me recite what I have fashioned for the king; \*   
my tongue shall be the pen of a skilled writer.  
> **2 You are the fairest of men; \*   
grace flows from your lips, 
because God has blessed you for ever.**
  
> 7 Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever, \*   
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom; 
you love righteousness and hate iniquity.  
> **8 Therefore God, your God, has anointed you \*   
with the oil of gladness above your fellows.**
  
> 9 All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, \*   
and the music of strings from ivory palaces makes you glad.  
> **10 Kings' daughters stand among the ladies of the court; \*   
on your right hand is the queen, 
adorned with the gold of Ophir.**
