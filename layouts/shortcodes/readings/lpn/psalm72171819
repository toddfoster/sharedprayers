_Deus, judicium_

> 1 Give the King your justice, O God, \*  
and your righteousness to the King's Son;  
> **2 That he may rule your people righteously \*  
and the poor with justice;**
  
> 3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, \*  
and the little hills bring righteousness.  
> **4 He shall defend the needy among the people; \*  
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.**
  
> 5 He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, \*  
from one generation to another.  
> **6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, \*  
like showers that water the earth.**
  
> 7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \*  
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.  
> **18 Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, \*  
who alone does wondrous deeds!**
  
> 19 And blessed be his glorious Name for ever! \*  
and may all the earth be filled with his glory.
Amen. Amen.
