_Confitemini Domino_

> 14 The LORD is my strength and my song, \*  
and he has become my salvation.  
> **15 There is a sound of exultation and victory \*  
in the tents of the righteous:**
  
> 16 "The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! \*  
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!"  
> **17 I shall not die, but live, \*  
and declare the works of the LORD.**
  
> 18 The LORD has punished me sorely, \*  
but he did not hand me over to death.  
> **19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; \*  
I will enter them;
I will offer thanks to the LORD.**
  
> 20 "This is the gate of the LORD; \*  
he who is righteous may enter."  
> **21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me \*  
and have become my salvation.**
  
> 22 The same stone which the builders rejected \*  
has become the chief cornerstone.  
> **23 This is the LORD'S doing, \*  
and it is marvelous in our eyes.**
  
> 24 On this day the LORD has acted; \*  
we will rejoice and be glad in it.  
> **25 Hosannah, LORD, hosannah! \*  
LORD, send us now success.**
  
> 26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; \*  
we bless you from the house of the LORD.  
> **27 God is the LORD; he has shined upon us; \*  
form a procession with branches up to the horns of the altar.**
  
> 28 "You are my God, and I will thank you; \*  
you are my God, and I will exalt you."  
> **29 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; \*  
his mercy endures for ever.**
