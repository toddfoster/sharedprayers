and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.  
> **13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; \*  
your dominion endures throughout all ages.**

and merciful in all his deeds.  
> **15 The LORD upholds all those who fall; \*  
he lifts up those who are bowed down.**
  
> 16 The eyes of all wait upon you, O LORD, \*  
and you give them their food in due season.  
> **17 You open wide your hand \*  
and satisfy the needs of every living creature.**
  
> 18 The LORD is righteous in all his ways \*  
and loving in all his works.  
> **19 The LORD is near to those who call upon him, \*  
to all who call upon him faithfully.**
