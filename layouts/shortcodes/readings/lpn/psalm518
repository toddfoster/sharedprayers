_Verba mea auribus_

> 1 Give ear to my words, O LORD; \*  
consider my meditation.  
> **2 Hearken to my cry for help, my King and my God, \*  
for I make my prayer to you.**
  
> 3 In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; \*  
early in the morning I make my appeal and watch for you.  
> **4 For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, \*  
and evil cannot dwell with you.**
  
> 5 Braggarts cannot stand in your sight; \*  
you hate all those who work wickedness.  
> **6 You destroy those who speak lies; \*  
the bloodthirsty and deceitful, O LORD, you abhor.**
  
> 7 But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy I will go into your house; \*  
I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.  
> **8 Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness,
because of those who lie in wait for me; \*  
make your way straight before me.**
