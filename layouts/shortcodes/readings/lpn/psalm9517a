_Venite, exultemus_

> 1 Come, let us sing to the LORD; \*  
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.  
> **2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving \*  
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.**
  
> 3 For the LORD is a great God, \*  
and a great King above all gods.  
> **4 In his hand are the caverns of the earth, \*  
and the heights of the hills are his also.**
  
> 5 The sea is his, for he made it, \*  
and his hands have molded the dry land.  
> **6 Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, \*  
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.**
  
> 7 For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
