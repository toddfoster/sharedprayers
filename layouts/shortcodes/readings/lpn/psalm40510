_Expectans, expectavi_

> 5 Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God! 
how great your wonders and your plans for us! \*   
there is none who can be compared with you.  
> **6 Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! \*   
but they are more than I can count.**
  
> 7 In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure \*   
(you have given me ears to hear you);  
> **8 Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, \*   
and so I said, "Behold, I come.**
  
> 9 In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: \*   
'I love to do your will, O my God; 
 your law is deep in my heart."'

10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; \*   
behold, I did not restrain my lips; 
and that, O LORD, you know.
