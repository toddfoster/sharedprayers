_Confitemini Domino_

> 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
> **2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**
  
> 3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.  
> **4 Some wandered in desert wastes; \*  
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.**
  
> 5 They were hungry and thirsty; \*  
their spirits languished within them.  
> **6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.**
  
> 7 He put their feet on a straight path \*  
to go to a city where they might dwell.  
> **33 The LORD changed rivers into deserts, \*  
and water-springs into thirsty ground,**
  
> 34 A fruitful land into salt flats, \*  
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.  
> **35 He changed deserts into pools of water \*  
and dry land into water-springs.**
  
> 36 He settled the hungry there, \*  
and they founded a city to dwell in.  
> **37 They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, \*  
and brought in a fruitful harvest.**
