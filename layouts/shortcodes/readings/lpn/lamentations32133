> This I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: 
> The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;
> they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
> “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in him.” 
> The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
> It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
> It is good for one to bear the yoke in youth,
> to sit alone in silence when the Lord has imposed it,
> to put one’s mouth to the dust (there may yet be hope),
> to give one’s cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults.
> For the Lord will not reject for ever.
> Although he causes grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;
> for he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.
