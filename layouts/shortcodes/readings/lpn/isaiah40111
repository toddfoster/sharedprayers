> Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. 
> Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her 
> that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, 
> that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins. 
> A voice cries out:
> “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
> Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low;
> the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.
> Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
> A voice says, “Cry out!” And I said, “What shall I cry?”
> All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.
> The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.
> The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.
> Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings;
> lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear;
> say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”
> See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him;
> his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
> He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms,
> and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.
