Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. Thus says the LORD:

> What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me, 
> and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?
> They did not say, "Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, 
> who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, 
> in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?" 
> I brought you into a plentiful land to eat its fruits and its good things.
> But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination. 
> The priests did not say, "Where is the LORD?" Those who handle the law did not know me; 
> the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit. 
> Therefore once more I accuse you, says the LORD, and I accuse your children's children. 
> Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing. 
> Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? 
> But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit. 
> Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate,
> says the LORD, 
> for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, 
> the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, 
> cracked cisterns that can hold no water.
