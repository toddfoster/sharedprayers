_Bonum est confiteri_

> 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, \*  
and to sing praises to your Name, O Most High;  
> **2 To tell of your loving-kindness early in the morning \*  
and of your faithfulness in the night season;**
  
> 3 On the psaltery, and on the lyre, \*  
and to the melody of the harp.  
> **4 For you have made me glad by your acts, O LORD; \*  
and I shout for joy because of the works of your hands.**
  
> 11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, \*  
and shall spread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon.  
> **12 Those who are planted in the house of the LORD \*  
shall flourish in the courts of our God;**
  
> 13 They shall still bear fruit in old age; \*  
they shall be green and succulent;  
> **14 That they may show how upright the LORD is, \*  
my Rock, in whom there is no fault.**
