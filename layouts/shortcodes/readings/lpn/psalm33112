_Exultate, justi_

> 1 Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; \*   
it is good for the just to sing praises.  
> **2 Praise the LORD with the harp; \*   
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.**
  
> 3 Sing for him a new song; \*   
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.  
> **4 For the word of the LORD is right, \*   
and all his works are sure.**
  
> 5 He loves righteousness and justice; \*   
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.  
> **6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, \*   
by the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts.**
  
> 7 He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin \*   
and stores up the depths of the sea.  
> **8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; \*   
let all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him.**
  
> 9 For he spoke, and it came to pass; \*   
he commanded, and it stood fast.  
> **10 The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; \*   
he thwarts the designs of the peoples.**
  
> 11 But the LORD'S will stands fast for ever, \*   
and the designs of his heart from age to age.  
> **12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! \*   
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!**
