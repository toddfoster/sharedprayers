_Confitemini Domino_

> 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
> **2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**
  
> 3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.  
> **4 Some wandered in desert wastes; \*  
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.**
  
> 5 They were hungry and thirsty; \*  
their spirits languished within them.  
> **6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.**
  
> 7 He put their feet on a straight path \*  
to go to a city where they might dwell.  
> **8 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy \*  
and the wonders he does for his children.**
  
> 9 For he satisfies the thirsty \*  
and fills the hungry with good things.  
> **43 Whoever is wise will ponder these things, \*  
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.**
