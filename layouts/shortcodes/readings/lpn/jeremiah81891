> My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick. 
> Hark, the cry of my poor people from far and wide in the land: 
> "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?" 
> ("Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols?") 
> "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved." 
> For the hurt of my poor people I am hurt, I mourn, and dismay has taken hold of me. 
> Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? 
> Why then has the health of my poor people not been restored? 
> O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, 
> so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my poor people!
