> O LORD, you have enticed me, and I was enticed; 
> you have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. 
> I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me. 
> For whenever I speak, I must cry out, I must shout, "Violence and destruction!" 
> For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long.
> If I say, "I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name," 
> then within me there is something like a burning fire shut up in my bones; 
> I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot. 
> For I hear many whispering: "Terror is all around! 
> Denounce him! Let us denounce him!" All my close friends are watching for me to stumble. 
> "Perhaps he can be enticed, and we can prevail against him, and take our revenge on him."
> But the LORD is with me like a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail. 
> They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten. O LORD of hosts, you test the righteous, you see the heart and the mind; let me see your retribution upon them, for to you I have committed my cause. Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.
