_Beati immaculati_

> 1 Happy are they whose way is blameless, \*  
who walk in the law of the LORD!  
> **2 Happy are they who observe his decrees \*  
and seek him with all their hearts!**
  
> 3 Who never do any wrong, \*  
but always walk in his ways.  
> **4 You laid down your commandments, \*  
that we should fully keep them.**
  
> 5 Oh, that my ways were made so direct \*  
that I might keep your statutes!  
> **6 Then I should not be put to shame, \*  
when I regard all your commandments.**
  
> 7 I will thank you with an unfeigned heart, \*  
when I have learned your righteous judgments.  
> **8 I will keep your statutes; \*  
do not utterly forsake me.**
