_Confitemini Domino_

> 19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; \*  
    I will enter them;
    I will offer thanks to the LORD.  
> **20 "This is the gate of the LORD; \*  
    he who is righteous may enter."**
  
> 21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me \*  
    and have become my salvation.   
> **22 The same stone which the builders rejected \*  
    has become the chief cornerstone.**
  
> 23 This is the LORD's doing, \*  
    and it is marvelous in our eyes.   
> **24 On this day the LORD has acted; \*  
    we will rejoice and be glad in it.**
