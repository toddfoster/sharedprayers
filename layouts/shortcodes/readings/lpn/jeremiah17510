Thus says the LORD:

> Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their strength, whose hearts turn away from the LORD. 
> They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief comes. 
> They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land. 
> Blessed are those who trust in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.
> They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream.
> It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green;
> in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit.
> The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse-- who can understand it? 
> I the LORD test the mind and search the heart, 
> to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.
