In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:

> "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory." 

The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: "Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"

Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: "Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out." Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I; send me!" [And he said, "Go and say to this people:

> `Keep listening, but do not comprehend;
> keep looking, but do not understand.' 
> Make the mind of this people dull, and stop their ears, and shut their eyes,
> so that they may not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears, 
> and comprehend with their minds, and turn and be healed." 

Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said:

> "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, 
> and houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate; 
> until the Lord sends everyone far away, and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.
> Even if a tenth part remain in it, it will be burned again, 
> like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains standing when it is felled." 
> The holy seed is its stump.]
