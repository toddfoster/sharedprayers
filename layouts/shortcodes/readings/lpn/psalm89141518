_Misericordias Domini_

> 1 Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; \*  
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.  
> **2 For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; \*  
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.**
  
> 3 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; \*  
 I have sworn an oath to David my servant:  
> **4 'I will establish your line for ever, \*  
and preserve your throne for all generations.'"**
  
> 15 Happy are the people who know the festal shout! \*  
they walk, O LORD, in the light of your presence.  
> **16 They rejoice daily in your Name; \*  
they are jubilant in your righteousness.**
  
> 17 For you are the glory of their strength, \*  
and by your favor our might is exalted.  
> **18 Truly, the LORD is our ruler; \*  
the Holy One of Israel is our King.**
