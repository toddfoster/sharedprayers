_Qui habitat_

> 9 Because you have made the LORD your refuge, \*  
and the Most High your habitation,  
> **10 There shall no evil happen to you, \*  
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.**
  
> 11 For he shall give his angels charge over you, \*  
to keep you in all your ways.  
> **12 They shall bear you in their hands, \*  
lest you dash your foot against a stone.**
  
> 13 You shall tread upon the lion and adder; \*  
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.  
> **14 Because he is bound to me in love,
therefore will I deliver him; \*  
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.**
  
> 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; \*  
I am with him in trouble;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.  
> **16 With long life will I satisfy him, \*  
and show him my salvation.**
