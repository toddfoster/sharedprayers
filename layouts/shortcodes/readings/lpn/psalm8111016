_Exultate Deo_

> 1 Sing with joy to God our strength \*  
and raise a loud shout to the God of Jacob.  
> **10 I am the LORD your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt and said, \*  
"Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it."**
  
> 11 And yet my people did not hear my voice, \*  
and Israel would not obey me.  
> **12 So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their hearts, \*  
to follow their own devices.**
  
> 13 Oh, that my people would listen to me! \*  
that Israel would walk in my ways!  
> **14 I should soon subdue their enemies \*  
and turn my hand against their foes.**
  
> 15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, \*  
and their punishment would last for ever.  
> **16 But Israel would I feed with the finest wheat \*  
and satisfy him with honey from the rock.**
