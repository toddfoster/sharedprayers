> The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall! 
> My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me. 
> But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: 
> The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; 
> they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. 
> "The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him." 
> The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
> It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
