Thus says the LORD:

> Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; 
> proclaim, give praise, and say, "Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel." 
> See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, 
> among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here. 
> With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back, 
> I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble; 
> for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
> Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; 
> say, "He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock." 
> For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
> They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD, 
> over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; 
> their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again. 
> Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry. 
> I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow. 
> I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty, 

says the LORD.
