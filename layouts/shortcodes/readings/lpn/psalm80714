_Qui regis Israel_

> 7 Restore us, O God of hosts; \*  
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.  
> **8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt; \*  
you cast out the nations and planted it.**
  
> 9 You prepared the ground for it; \*  
it took root and filled the land.  
> **10 The mountains were covered by its shadow \*  
and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.**
  
> 11 You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea \*  
and its branches to the River.  
> **12 Why have you broken down its wall, \*  
so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?**
  
> 13 The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, \*  
and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.  
> **14 Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven;
behold and tend this vine; \*  
preserve what your right hand has planted.**
