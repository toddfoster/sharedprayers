> Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, 
> saying, "When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; 
> and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? 
> We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, 
> buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat." 
> The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
> Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
