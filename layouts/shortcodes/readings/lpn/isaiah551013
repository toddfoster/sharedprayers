> As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, 
> making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 
> so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, 
> but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
> For you shall go out in joy, and be led back in peace; 
> the mountains and the hills before you shall burst into song, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. 
> Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; 
> and it shall be to the LORD for a memorial, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
