> Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice? 
> On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand; 
> beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out: 
> "To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live. 
> The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago. 
> Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. 
> When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. 
> Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth-- 
> when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world's first bits of soil. 
> When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, 
> when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, 
> when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, 
> when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master worker; 
> and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, 
> rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race."
