_Domine, Deus meus_

> 1 O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; \*  
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;  
> **2 Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces \*  
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.**
  
> 3 O LORD my God, if I have done these things: \*  
if there is any wickedness in my hands,  
> **4 If I have repaid my friend with evil, \*  
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;**
  
> 5 Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, \*  
trample my life into the ground,
and lay my honor in the dust.  
> **6 Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; \*  
rise up against the fury of my enemies.**
  
> 7 Awake, O my God, decree justice; \*  
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.  
> **8 Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; \*  
O LORD, judge the nations.**
  
> 9 Give judgment for me according to my righteousness, O LORD, \*  
and according to my innocence, O Most High.  
> **10 Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,
but establish the righteous; \*  
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.**
