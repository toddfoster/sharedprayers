> Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,
> who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior;
> they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:
> Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.
> I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
> I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
> The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches;
> for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert,
> to give drink to my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself
> so that they might declare my praise.
