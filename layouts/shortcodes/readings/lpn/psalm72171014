_Deus, judicium_

> 1 Give the King your justice, O God, \*  
and your righteousness to the King's Son;  
> **2 That he may rule your people righteously \*  
and the poor with justice;**
  
> 3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, \*  
and the little hills bring righteousness.  
> **4 He shall defend the needy among the people; \*  
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.**
  
> 5 He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, \*  
from one generation to another.  
> **6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, \*  
like showers that water the earth.**
  
> 7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; \*  
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.  
> **10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute, \*  
and the kings of Arabia and Saba offer gifts.**
  
> 11 All kings shall bow down before him, \*  
and all the nations do him service.  
> **12 For he shall deliver the poor who cries out in distress, \*  
and the oppressed who has no helper.**
  
> 13 He shall have pity on the lowly and poor; \*  
he shall preserve the lives of the needy.  
> **14 He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, \*  
and dear shall their blood be in his sight.**
