> If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, 
> if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, 
> then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.
> The LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; 
> and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail. 
> Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; 
> you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in. 
> If you refrain from trampling the sabbath, from pursuing your own interests on my holy day; 
> if you call the sabbath a delight and the holy day of the LORD honorable; 
> if you honor it, not going your own ways, serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs; 
> then you shall take delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth; 
> I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
