_Legem pone_

> 33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes, \*  
and I shall keep it to the end.  
> **34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law; \*  
I shall keep it with all my heart.**
  
> 35 Make me go in the path of your commandments, \*  
for that is my desire.  
> **36 Incline my heart to your decrees \*  
and not to unjust gain.**
  
> 37 Turn my eyes from watching what is worthless; \*  
give me life in your ways.  
> **38 Fulfill your promise to your servant, \*  
which you make to those who fear you.**
  
> 39 Turn away the reproach which I dread, \*  
because your judgments are good.  
> **40 Behold, I long for your commandments; \*  
in your righteousness preserve my life.**
