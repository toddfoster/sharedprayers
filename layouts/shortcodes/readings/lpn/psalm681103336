_Exsurgat Deus_

> 1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; \*  
let those who hate him flee before him.  
> **2 Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; \*  
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.**
  
> 3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; \*  
let them also be merry and joyful.  
> **4 Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; \*  
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!**
  
> 5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, \*  
God in his holy habitation!  
> **6 God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners into freedom; \*  
but the rebels shall live in dry places.**
  
> 7 O God, when you went forth before your people, \*  
when you marched through the wilderness,  
> **8 The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, \*  
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.**
  
> 9 You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; \*  
you refreshed the land when it was weary.  
> **10 Your people found their home in it; \*  
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision for the poor.**
  
> 33 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; \*  
sing praises to the Lord.  
> **34 He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; \*  
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.**
  
> 35 Ascribe power to God; \*  
his majesty is over Israel;
his strength is in the skies.  
> **36 How wonderful is God in his holy places! \*  
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his people!
Blessed be God!**
