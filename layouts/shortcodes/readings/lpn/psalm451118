_Eructavit cor meum_

> 11 "Hear, O daughter; consider and listen closely; \*   
forget your people and your father's house.  
> **12 The king will have pleasure in your beauty; \*   
he is your master; therefore do him honor.**
  
> 13 The people of Tyre are here with a gift; \*   
the rich among the people seek your favor."

14 All glorious is the princess as she enters; \*   
her gown is cloth-of-gold.
15 In embroidered apparel she is brought to the king; \*   
after her the bridesmaids follow in procession.
16 With joy and gladness they are brought, \*   
and enter into the palace of the king.
17 "In place of fathers, O king, you shall have sons; \*   
you shall make them princes over all the earth.
18 I will make your name to be remembered 
from one generation to another; \*   
therefore nations will praise you for ever and ever."
