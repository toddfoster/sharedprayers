_Lucerna pedibus meis_

> 105 Your word is a lantern to my feet \*  
and a light upon my path.  
> **106 I have sworn and am determined \*  
to keep your righteous judgments.**
  
> 107 I am deeply troubled; \*  
preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.  
> **108 Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, \*  
and teach me your judgments.**
  
> 109 My life is always in my hand, \*  
yet I do not forget your law.  
> **110 The wicked have set a trap for me, \*  
but I have not strayed from your commandments.**
  
> 111 Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; \*  
truly, they are the joy of my heart.  
> **112 I have applied my heart to fulfill your statutes \*  
for ever and to the end.**
