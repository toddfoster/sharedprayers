_Jubilate Deo_

> 7 Bless our God, you peoples; \*  
make the voice of his praise to be heard;  
> **8 Who holds our souls in life, \*  
and will not allow our feet to slip.**
  
> 9 For you, O God, have proved us; \*  
you have tried us just as silver is tried.  
> **10 You brought us into the snare; \*  
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.**
  
> 11 You let enemies ride over our heads;
we went through fire and water; \*  
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.  
> **12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings
and will pay you my vows, \*  
which I promised with my lips
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.**
  
> 13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts
with the smoke of rams; \*  
I will give you oxen and goats.  
> **14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, \*  
and I will tell you what he has done for me.**
  
> 15 I called out to him with my mouth, \*  
and his praise was on my tongue.  
> **16 If I had found evil in my heart, \*  
the Lord would not have heard me;**
  
> 17 But in truth God has heard me; \*  
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.  
> **18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, \*  
nor withheld his love from me.**
