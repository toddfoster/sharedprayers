> Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 
> I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god. 
> Who is like me? Let them proclaim it, let them declare and set it forth before me. 
> Who has announced from of old the things to come? Let them tell us what is yet to be. 
> Do not fear, or be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? You are my witnesses! 
> Is there any god besides me? There is no other rock; I know not one.
