> I am about to create new heavens and a new earth; 
> the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.
> But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;
> for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight. 
> I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; 
> no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress. 
> No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime; 
> for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed. 
> They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 
> They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; 
> for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 
> They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; 
> for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord-- and their descendants as well. 
> Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear. 
> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent-- its food shall be dust! 
> They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.
