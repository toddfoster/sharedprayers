> Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray,
> who cry “Peace” when they have something to eat, 
> but declare war against those who put nothing into their mouths.
> Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without revelation. 
> The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them; 
> the seers shall be disgraced, and the diviners put to shame; 
> they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God. 
> But as for me, I am filled with power, with the spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, 
> to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin. 
> Hear this, you rulers of the house of Jacob and chiefs of the house of Israel, 
> who abhor justice and pervert all equity, 
> who build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with wrong! 
> Its rulers give judgment for a bribe, its priests teach for a price, its prophets give oracles for money; 
> yet they lean upon the LORD and say, “Surely the LORD is with us! No harm shall come upon us.” 
> Therefore because of you Zion shall be plowed as a field; 
> Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooded height.
