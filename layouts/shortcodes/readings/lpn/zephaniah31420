> Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel! 
> Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem! 
> The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies. 
> The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more. 
> On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
> Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.
> The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; 
> he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love; 
> he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival. 
> I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it. 
> I will deal with all your oppressors at that time. 
> And I will save the lame and gather the outcast, 
> and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth. 
> At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you; 
> for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth, 
> when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.
