_Inclina, Domine_

> 11 Teach me your way, O LORD,
and I will walk in your truth; \*  
knit my heart to you that I may fear your Name.  
> **12 I will thank you, O LORD my God, with all my heart, \*  
and glorify your Name for evermore.**
  
> 13 For great is your love toward me; \*  
you have delivered me from the nethermost Pit.  
> **14 The arrogant rise up against me, O God,
and a band of violent men seeks my life; \*  
they have not set you before their eyes.**
  
> 15 But you, O LORD, are gracious and full of compassion, \*  
slow to anger, and full of kindness and truth.  
> **16 Turn to me and have mercy upon me; \*  
give your strength to your servant;
and save the child of your handmaid.**
  
> 17 Show me a sign of your favor,
so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; \*  
because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
