At that time, says the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

Thus says the LORD:

> The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; 
> when Israel sought for rest, the LORD appeared to him from far away. 
> I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
> Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel! 
> Again you shall take your tambourines, and go forth in the dance of the merrymakers. 
> Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; 
> the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit. 
> For there shall be a day when sentinels will call in the hill country of Ephraim: 
> “Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.”
