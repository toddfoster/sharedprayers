_Domine, refugium_

> 12 So teach us to number our days \*  
that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.  
> **13 Return, O LORD; how long will you tarry? \*  
be gracious to your servants.**
  
> 14 Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; \*  
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.  
> **15 Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us \*  
and the years in which we suffered adversity.**
  
> 16 Show your servants your works \*  
and your splendor to their children.  
> **17 May the graciousness of the LORD our God be upon us; \*  
prosper the work of our hands;
prosper our handiwork.**
