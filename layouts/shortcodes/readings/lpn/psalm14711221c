_Laudate Dominum_

> 1 Hallelujah!
How good it is to sing praises to our God! \*  
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!  
> **2 The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; \*  
he gathers the exiles of Israel.**
  
> 3 He heals the brokenhearted \*  
and binds up their wounds.  
> **4 He counts the number of the stars \*  
and calls them all by their names.**
  
> 5 Great is our LORD and mighty in power; \*  
there is no limit to his wisdom.  
> **6 The LORD lifts up the lowly, \*  
but casts the wicked to the ground.**
  
> 7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; \*  
make music to our God upon the harp.  
> **8 He covers the heavens with clouds \*  
and prepares rain for the earth;**
  
> 9 He makes grass to grow upon the mountains \*  
and green plants to serve mankind.  
> **10 He provides food for flocks and herds \*  
and for the young ravens when they cry.**
  
> 11 He is not impressed by the might of a horse; \*  
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;  
> **12 But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, \*  
in those who await his gracious favor.**
  
> 21 Hallelujah!
