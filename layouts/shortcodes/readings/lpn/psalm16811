_Conserva me, Domine_

> 8
          I have set the LORD always before me; \*  
      because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.  
> **9
        My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; \*  
        my body also shall rest in hope.**
  
> 10
        For you will not abandon me to the grave, \*  
        nor let your holy one see the Pit.  
> **11
        You will show me the path of life; \*  
        in your presence there is fullness of joy,
        and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.**
