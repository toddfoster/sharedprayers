> Thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob, 
> he who formed you, O Israel:
> Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 
> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; 
> when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 
> For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. 
> I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you. 
> Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you, 
> I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life. 
> Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you; 
> I will say to the north, "Give them up," and to the south, "Do not withhold; 
> bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth--
> everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
