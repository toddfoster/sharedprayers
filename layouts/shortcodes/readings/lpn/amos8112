This is what the Lord GOD showed me-- a basket of summer fruit. He said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me,

> "The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by. 
> The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day," says the Lord GOD; 
> "the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!" 
> Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, 
> saying, "When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; 
> and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? 
> We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, 
> buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat." 
> The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
> Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.
> Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it, 
> and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt? 
> On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight. 
> I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; 
> I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; 
> I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day. 
> The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land; 
> not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD. 
> They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; 
> they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.
