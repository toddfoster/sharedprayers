> I was ready to be sought out by those who did not ask, to be found by those who did not seek me. 
> I said, "Here I am, here I am," to a nation that did not call on my name. 
> I held out my hands all day long to a rebellious people,
> who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices; 
> a people who provoke me to my face continually, 
> sacrificing in gardens and offering incense on bricks; 
> who sit inside tombs, and spend the night in secret places; 
> who eat swine's flesh, with broth of abominable things in their vessels; 
> who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too holy for you." 
> These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all day long. 
> See, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; 
> I will indeed repay into their laps their iniquities and their ancestors' iniquities together,
> says the LORD; 
> because they offered incense on the mountains and reviled me on the hills, 
> I will measure into their laps full payment for their actions. 
> Thus says the LORD:
> As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, "Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it," 
> so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all. 
> I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; 
> my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there.
