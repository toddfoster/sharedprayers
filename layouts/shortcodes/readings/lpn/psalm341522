_Benedicam Dominum_

> 15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, \*   
and his ears are open to their cry.  
> **16 The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, \*   
to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.**
  
> 17 The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them \*   
and delivers them from all their troubles.  
> **18 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted \*   
and will save those whose spirits are crushed.**
  
> 19 Many are the troubles of the righteous, \*   
but the LORD will deliver him out of them all.  
> **20 He will keep safe all his bones; \*   
not one of them shall be broken.**
  
> 21 Evil shall slay the wicked, \*   
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.  
> **22 The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, \*   
and none will be punished who trust in him.**
