_Expectans, expectavi_

> 1 I waited patiently upon the LORD; \*   
he stooped to me and heard my cry.  
> **2 He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and clay; \*   
he set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing sure.**
  
> 3 He put a new song in my mouth, 
a song of praise to our God; \*   
many shall see, and stand in awe, 
and put their trust in the LORD.  
> **4 Happy are they who trust in the LORD! \*   
they do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false gods.**
  
> 5 Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God! 
how great your wonders and your plans for us! \*   
there is none who can be compared with you.  
> **6 Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! \*   
but they are more than I can count.**
  
> 7 In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure \*   
(you have given me ears to hear you);  
> **8 Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, \*   
and so I said, "Behold, I come.**
  
> 9 In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: \*   
'I love to do your will, O my God; 
 your law is deep in my heart."'
 
10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; \*   
behold, I did not restrain my lips; 
and that, O LORD, you know.
11 Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart; 
I have spoken of your faithfulness and your deliverance; \*   
I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the great congregation.
12 You are the LORD; 
do not withhold your compassion from me; \*   
let your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for ever,
