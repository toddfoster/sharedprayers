> Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is at hand; 
> the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has consecrated his guests. 
> At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the people 
> who rest complacently on their dregs, those who say in their hearts, 
> “The LORD will not do good, nor will he do harm.” 
> Their wealth shall be plundered, and their houses laid waste. 
> Though they build houses, they shall not inhabit them; 
> though they plant vineyards, they shall not drink wine from them. 
> The great day of the LORD is near, near and hastening fast; 
> the sound of the day of the LORD is bitter, the warrior cries aloud there. 
> That day will be a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, 
> a day of ruin and devastation, a day of darkness and gloom, 
> a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of trumpet blast and battle cry 
> against the fortified cities and against the lofty battlements. 
> I will bring such distress upon people that they shall walk like the blind; because they have sinned against the LORD, 
> their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung. 
> Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD's wrath; 
> in the fire of his passion the whole earth shall be consumed; 
> for a full, a terrible end he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth.
