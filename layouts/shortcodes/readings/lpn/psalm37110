_Noli aemulari_

> 1 Do not fret yourself because of evildoers; \*   
do not be jealous of those who do wrong.  
> **2 For they shall soon wither like the grass, \*   
and like the green grass fade away.**
  
> 3 Put your trust in the LORD and do good; \*   
dwell in the land and feed on its riches.  
> **4 Take delight in the LORD, \*   
and he shall give you your heart's desire.**
  
> 5 Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, \*   
and he will bring it to pass.  
> **6 He will make your righteousness as clear as the light \*   
and your just dealing as the noonday.**
  
> 7 Be still before the LORD \*   
and wait patiently for him.  
> **8 Do not fret yourself over the one who prospers, \*   
the one who succeeds in evil schemes.**
  
> 9 Refrain from anger, leave rage alone; \*   
do not fret yourself; it leads only to evil.  
> **10 For evildoers shall be cut off, \*   
but those who wait upon the LORD shall possess the land.**
