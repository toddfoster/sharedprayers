_Exaltabo te, Deus_

> 8 The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, \*  
slow to anger and of great kindness.  
> **9 The LORD is loving to everyone \*  
and his compassion is over all his works.**
  
> 15 The LORD upholds all those who fall; \*  
he lifts up those who are bowed down.  
> **16 The eyes of all wait upon you, O LORD, \*  
and you give them their food in due season.**
  
> 17 You open wide your hand \*  
and satisfy the needs of every living creature.  
> **18 The LORD is righteous in all his ways \*  
and loving in all his works.**
  
> 19 The LORD is near to those who call upon him, \*  
to all who call upon him faithfully.  
> **20 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; \*  
he hears their cry and helps them.**
  
> 21 The LORD preserves all those who love him, \*  
but he destroys all the wicked.  
> **22 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; \*  
let all flesh bless his holy Name for ever and ever.**
