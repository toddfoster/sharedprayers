> Let me sing for my beloved my love-song concerning his vineyard: 
> My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. 
> He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; 
> he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; 
> he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. 
> And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, 
> judge between me and my vineyard. 
> What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? 
> When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes? 
> And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. 
> I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; 
> I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. 
> I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; 
> I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 
> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, 
> and the people of Judah are his pleasant planting; 
> he expected justice, but saw bloodshed; 
> righteousness, but heard a cry!
