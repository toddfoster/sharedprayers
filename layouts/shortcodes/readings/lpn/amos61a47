> Alas for those who are at ease in Zion, and for those who feel secure on Mount Samaria. 
> Alas for those who lie on beds of ivory, and lounge on their couches, 
> and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the stall; 
> who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp, and like David improvise on instruments of music; 
> who drink wine from bowls, and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph! 
> Therefore they shall now be the first to go into exile, and the revelry of the loungers shall pass away.
