_Benedic, anima mea_

> 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul, \*  
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.  
> **2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, \*  
and forget not all his benefits.**
  
> 3 He forgives all your sins \*  
and heals all your infirmities;  
> **4 He redeems your life from the grave \*  
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;**
  
> 5 He satisfies you with good things, \*  
and your youth is renewed like an eagle's.  
> **6 The LORD executes righteousness \*  
and judgment for all who are oppressed.**
  
> 7 He made his ways known to Moses \*  
and his works to the children of Israel.  
> **8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, \*  
slow to anger and of great kindness.**
