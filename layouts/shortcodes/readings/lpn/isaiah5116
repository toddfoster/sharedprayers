> Listen to me, you that pursue righteousness, you that seek the LORD.
> Look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
> Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who bore you;
> for he was but one when I called him, but I blessed him and made him many.
> For the LORD will comfort Zion; he will comfort all her waste places,
> and will make her wilderness like Eden, her desert like the garden of the LORD;
> joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the voice of song.
> Listen to me, my people, and give heed to me, my nation;
> for a teaching will go out from me, and my justice for a light to the peoples.
> I will bring near my deliverance swiftly, my salvation has gone out and my arms will rule the peoples;
> the coastlands wait for me, and for my arm they hope.
> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath;
> for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and those who live on it will die like gnats;
> but my salvation will be for ever, and my deliverance will never be ended.
