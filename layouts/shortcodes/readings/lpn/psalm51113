_Miserere mei, Deus_

> 1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; \*  
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.  
> **2 Wash me through and through from my wickedness \*  
and cleanse me from my sin.**
  
> 3 For I know my transgressions, \*  
and my sin is ever before me.  
> **4 Against you only have I sinned \*  
and done what is evil in your sight.**
  
> 5 And so you are justified when you speak \*  
and upright in your judgment.  
> **6 Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, \*  
a sinner from my mother's womb.**
  
> 7 For behold, you look for truth deep within me, \*  
and will make me understand wisdom secretly.  
> **8 Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; \*  
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.**
  
> 9 Make me hear of joy and gladness, \*  
that the body you have broken may rejoice.  
> **10 Hide your face from my sins \*  
and blot out all my iniquities.**
  
> 11 Create in me a clean heart, O God, \*  
and renew a right spirit within me.  
> **12 Cast me not away from your presence \*  
and take not your holy Spirit from me.**
  
> 13 Give me the joy of your saving help again \*  
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
