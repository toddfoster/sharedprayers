_Deus, venerunt_

> 1 O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance;
they have profaned your holy temple; \*  
they have made Jerusalem a heap of rubble.  
> **2 They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the air, \*  
and the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the field.**
  
> 3 They have shed their blood like water on every side of Jerusalem, \*  
and there was no one to bury them.  
> **4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, \*  
an object of scorn and derision to those around us.**
  
> 5 How long will you be angry, O LORD? \*  
will your fury blaze like fire for ever?  
> **6 Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not known you \*  
and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.**
  
> 7 For they have devoured Jacob \*  
and made his dwelling a ruin.  
> **8 Remember not our past sins;
let your compassion be swift to meet us; \*  
for we have been brought very low.**
  
> 9 Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your Name; \*  
deliver us and forgive us our sins, for your Name's sake.
