The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

> In days to come the mountain of the LORD’s house
> shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills;
> all the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say,
> ‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
> that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.’
> For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
> He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples;
> they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
> O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!
