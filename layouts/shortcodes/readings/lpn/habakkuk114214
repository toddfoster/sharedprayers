> The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw.
> O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? 
> Or cry to you "Violence!" and you will not save? 
> Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble? 
> Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.
> So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails.
> The wicked surround the righteous-- therefore judgment comes forth perverted.
> I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart; 
> I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint. 
> Then the LORD answered me and said:
> Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.
> For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie. 
> If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.
> Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.
