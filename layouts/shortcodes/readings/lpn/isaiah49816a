> Thus says the LORD:
> In a time of favor I have answered you, on a day of salvation I have helped you;
> I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people,
> to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages;
> saying to the prisoners, “Come out,”, to those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves.”
> They shall feed along the ways, on all the bare heights shall be their pasture;
> they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them down,
> for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.
> And I will turn all my mountains into a road, and my highways shall be raised up.
> Lo, these shall come from far away, and lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Syene.
> Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; break forth, O mountains, into singing!
> For the LORD has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones.
> But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me, my LORD has forgotten me.”
> Can a woman forget her nursing-child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb?
> Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. 
> See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands.
