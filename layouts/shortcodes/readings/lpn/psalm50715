_Deus deorum_

> 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak:
"O Israel, I will bear witness against you; \*  
for I am God, your God.  
> **8 I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; \*  
your offerings are always before me.**
  
> 9 I will take no bull-calf from your stalls, \*  
nor he-goats out of your pens;  
> **10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, \*  
the herds in their thousands upon the hills.**
  
> 11 I know every bird in the sky, \*  
and the creatures of the fields are in my sight.  
> **12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, \*  
for the whole world is mine and all that is in it.**
  
> 13 Do you think I eat the flesh of bulls, \*  
or drink the blood of goats?  
> **14 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving \*  
and make good your vows to the Most High.**
  
> 15 Call upon me in the day of trouble; \*  
I will deliver you, and you shall honor me."
