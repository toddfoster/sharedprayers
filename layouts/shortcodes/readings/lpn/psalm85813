_Benedixisti, Domine_

> 8 I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, \*  
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people
and to those who turn their hearts to him.  
> **9 Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, \*  
that his glory may dwell in our land.**
  
> 10 Mercy and truth have met together; \*  
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.  
> **11 Truth shall spring up from the earth, \*  
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.**
  
> 12 The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, \*  
and our land will yield its increase.  
> **13 Righteousness shall go before him, \*  
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.**
