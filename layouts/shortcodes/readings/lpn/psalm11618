_Dilexi, quoniam_

> 1 I love the  LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, \*  
  because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.  
> **2 The cords of death entangled me;
  the grip of the grave took hold of me; \*  
  I came to grief and sorrow.**
  
> 3 Then I called upon the Name of the  LORD: \*  
  "O  LORD, I pray you, save my life."  
> **4 Gracious is the  LORD and righteous; \*  
  our God is full of compassion.**
  
> 5 The  LORD watches over the innocent; \*  
  I was brought very low, and he helped me.  
> **6 Turn again to your rest, O my soul, \*  
  for the  LORD has treated you well.**
  
> 7 For you have rescued my life from death, \*  
  my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.  
> **8 I will walk in the presence of the  LORD \*  
  in the land of the living.**
