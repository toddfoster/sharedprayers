> You, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, 
> from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, 
> whose origin is from of old, from ancient days. 
> Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; 
> then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel. 
> And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. 
> And they shall live secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth; 
> and he shall be the one of peace.
