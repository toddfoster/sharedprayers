> Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord:
> Alas for you who desire the day of the LORD! Why do you want the day of the LORD? 
> It is darkness, not light; as if someone fled from a lion, and was met by a bear; 
> or went into the house and rested a hand against the wall, and was bitten by a snake.
> Is not the day of the LORD darkness, not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?
> I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. 
> Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them;
> and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals I will not look upon.
> Take away from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your harps. 
> But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream.
