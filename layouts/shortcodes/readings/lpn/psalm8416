_Quam dilecta!_

> 1 How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! \*  
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.  
> **2 The sparrow has found her a house
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; \*  
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,
my King and my God.**
  
> 3 Happy are they who dwell in your house! \*  
they will always be praising you.  
> **4 Happy are the people whose strength is in you! \*  
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims' way.**
  
> 5 Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, \*  
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.  
> **6 They will climb from height to height, \*  
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.**
