> For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, 
> until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch. 
> The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory; 
> and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give. 
> You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 
> You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate; 
> but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; 
> for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married. 
> For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, 
> and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.
