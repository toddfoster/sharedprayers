> O LORD, you know; remember me and visit me, and bring down retribution for me on my persecutors.
> In your forbearance do not take me away; know that on your account I suffer insult.
> Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart;
> for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.
> I did not sit in the company of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice;
> under the weight of your hand I sat alone, for you had filled me with indignation.
> Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?
> Truly, you are to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail.
> Therefore, thus says the LORD:
> If you turn back, I will take you back, and you shall stand before me.
> If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, you shall serve as my mouth.
> It is they who will turn to you, not you who will turn to them.
> And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze;
> they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you,
> for I am with you to save you and deliver you,
> says the LORD.
> I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.
