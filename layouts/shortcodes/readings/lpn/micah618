> Hear what the LORD says: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
> Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth;
> for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
> “O my people, what have I done to you? In what have I wearied you? Answer me!
> For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery;
> and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
> O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised, what Balaam son of Beor answered him,
> and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD.”
> “With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high?
> Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?
> Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of rivers of oil?
> Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”
> He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you
> but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
