At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A hot wind comes from me out of the bare heights in the desert toward my poor people, not to winnow or cleanse-- a wind too strong for that. Now it is I who speak in judgment against them.

> "For my people are foolish, 
> they do not know me; 
> they are stupid children, 
> they have no understanding. 
>
> They are skilled in doing evil, 
> but do not know how to do good." 
> 
> I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; 
> and to the heavens, and they had no light. 
> I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, 
> and all the hills moved to and fro. 
> I looked, and lo, there was no one at all, 
> and all the birds of the air had fled. 
> I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, 
> and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger. 

For thus says the LORD: The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.

> Because of this the earth shall mourn, 
> and the heavens above grow black; 
> for I have spoken, I have purposed; 
> I have not relented nor will I turn back.
