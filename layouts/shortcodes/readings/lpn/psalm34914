_Benedicam Dominum_

> 9 Fear the LORD, you that are his saints, \*   
for those who fear him lack nothing.  
> **10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger, \*   
but those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is good.**
  
> 11 Come, children, and listen to me; \*   
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.  
> **12 Who among you loves life \*   
and desires long life to enjoy prosperity?**
  
> 13 Keep your tongue from evil-speaking \*   
and your lips from lying words.  
> **14 Turn from evil and do good; \*   
seek peace and pursue it.**
