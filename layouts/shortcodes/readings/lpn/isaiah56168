> Thus says the LORD: Maintain justice, and do what is right,
> for soon my salvation will come, and my deliverance be revealed. 
> And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be his servants, 
> all who keep the sabbath, and do not profane it, and hold fast my covenant-- 
> these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; 
> their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; 
> for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. 
> Thus says the Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, 
> I will gather others to them besides those already gathered.
