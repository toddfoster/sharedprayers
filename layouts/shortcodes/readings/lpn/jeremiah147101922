> Although our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for your name's sake; 
> our apostasies indeed are many, and we have sinned against you.
> O hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, 
> why should you be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler turning aside for the night? 
> Why should you be like someone confused, like a mighty warrior who cannot give help?
> Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not forsake us!
> Thus says the LORD concerning this people:
> Truly they have loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet;
> therefore the LORD does not accept them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. 
> Have you completely rejected Judah? Does your heart loathe Zion? 
> Why have you struck us down so that there is no healing for us?
> We look for peace, but find no good; for a time of healing, but there is terror instead.
> We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.
> Do not spurn us, for your name's sake; do not dishonor your glorious throne; remember and do not break your covenant with us. 
> Can any idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the heavens give showers? 
> Is it not you, O LORD our God? We set our hope on you, for it is you who do all this.
