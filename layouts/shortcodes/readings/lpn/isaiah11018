> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom!
> Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
> What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD;
> I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; 
> I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
> When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more; 
> bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. 
> New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation-- I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity. 
> Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; 
> they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them. 
> When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;
> even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. 
> Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes;
> cease to do evil, learn to do good; 
> seek justice, rescue the oppressed,
> defend the orphan, plead for the widow. 
> Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: 
> though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; 
> though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
