> I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart; 
> I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint. 
> Then the LORD answered me and said:
> Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it. 
> For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie. 
> If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay. 
> Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.
