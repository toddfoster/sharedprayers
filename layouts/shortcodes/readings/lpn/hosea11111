> When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 
> The more I called them, the more they went from me; 
> they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols. 
> Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them.
> I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. 
> I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them. 
> They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me. 
> The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes. 
> My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all. 
> How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? 
> How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? 
> My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. 
> I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; 
> for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.
> They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion; 
> when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west. 
> They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD.
