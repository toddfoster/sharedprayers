_Salvum me fac_

> 8 Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, \*  
and shame has covered my face.  
> **9 I have become a stranger to my own kindred, \*  
an alien to my mother's children.**
  
> 10 Zeal for your house has eaten me up; \*  
the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.  
> **11 I humbled myself with fasting, \*  
but that was turned to my reproach.**
  
> [12 I put on sack-cloth also, \*  
and became a byword among them.  
> **13 Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, \*  
and the drunkards make songs about me.**
  
> 14 But as for me, this is my prayer to you, \*  
at the time you have set, O LORD:  
> **15 "In your great mercy, O God, \*  
answer me with your unfailing help.**
  
> 16 Save me from the mire; do not let me sink; \*  
let me be rescued from those who hate me
and out of the deep waters.  
> **17 Let not the torrent of waters wash over me,
neither let the deep swallow me up; \*  
do not let the Pit shut its mouth upon me.]**
  
> 18 Answer me, O LORD, for your love is kind; \*  
in your great compassion, turn to me.'

19 "Hide not your face from your servant; \*  
be swift and answer me, for I am in distress.
20 Draw near to me and redeem me; \*  
because of my enemies deliver me.
