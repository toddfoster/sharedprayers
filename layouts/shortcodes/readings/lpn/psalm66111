_Jubilate Deo_

> 1 Be joyful in God, all you lands; \*  
sing the glory of his Name;
sing the glory of his praise.  
> **2 Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! \*  
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.**
  
> 3 All the earth bows down before you, \*  
sings to you, sings out your Name."  
> **4 Come now and see the works of God, \*  
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.**
  
> 5 He turned the sea into dry land,
so that they went through the water on foot, \*  
and there we rejoiced in him.  
> **6 In his might he rules for ever;
his eyes keep watch over the nations; \*  
let no rebel rise up against him.**
  
> 7 Bless our God, you peoples; \*  
make the voice of his praise to be heard;  
> **8 Who holds our souls in life, \*  
and will not allow our feet to slip.**
  
> 9 For you, O God, have proved us; \*  
you have tried us just as silver is tried.  
> **10 You brought us into the snare; \*  
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.**
  
> 11 You let enemies ride over our heads;
we went through fire and water; \*  
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.
