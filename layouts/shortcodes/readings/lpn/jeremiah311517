Thus says the LORD:

> A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. 

Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more. 

Thus says the LORD:

Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears;

for there is a reward for your work,

says the LORD: they shall come back from the land of the enemy; 

there is hope for your future,

says the LORD: your children shall come back to their own country.
