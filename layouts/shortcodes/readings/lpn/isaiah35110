> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; 
> like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing. 
> The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
> They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.
> Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
> Say to those who are of a fearful heart, "Be strong, do not fear! 
> Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, 
> with terrible recompense. He will come and save you." 
> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; 
> then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. 
> For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert; 
> the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; 
> the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes. 
> A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way; 
> the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God's people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray. 
> No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; 
> they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there. 
> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; 
> everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
