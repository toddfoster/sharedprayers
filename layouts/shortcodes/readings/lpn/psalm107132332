_Confitemini Domino_

> 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
> **2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**
  
> 3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,
from the north and from the south.  
> **23 Some went down to the sea in ships \*  
and plied their trade in deep waters;**
  
> 24 They beheld the works of the LORD \*  
and his wonders in the deep.  
> **25 Then he spoke, and a stormy wind arose, \*  
which tossed high the waves of the sea.**
  
> 26 They mounted up to the heavens and fell back to the depths; \*  
their hearts melted because of their peril.  
> **27 They reeled and staggered like drunkards \*  
and were at their wits' end.**
  
> 28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.  
> **29 He stilled the storm to a whisper \*  
and quieted the waves of the sea.**
  
> 30 Then were they glad because of the calm, \*  
and he brought them to the harbor they were bound for.  
> **31 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy \*  
and the wonders he does for his children.**
  
> 32 Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people \*  
and praise him in the council of the elders.
