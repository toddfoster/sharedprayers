_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1 In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
        let me never be put to shame; \*  
      deliver me in your righteousness.  
> **2 Incline your ear to me; \*  
      make haste to deliver me.**
  
> 3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,
        for you are my crag and my stronghold; \*  
        for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.  
> **4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, \*  
        for you are my tower of strength.**
  
> 15 My times are in your hand; \*  
        rescue me from the hand of my enemies,
        and from those who persecute me.  
> **16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, \*  
        and in your loving-kindness save me."**
