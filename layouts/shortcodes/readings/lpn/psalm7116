_In te, Domine, speravi_

> 1
    In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; \*  
    let me never be ashamed.  
> **2
    In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; \*  
    incline your ear to me and save me.**
  
> 3
    Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; \*  
    you are my crag and my stronghold.  
> **4
    Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, \*  
    from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.**
  
> 5
    For you are my hope, O Lord GOD, \*  
    my confidence since I was young.  
> **6
    I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;
    from my mother's womb you have been my strength; \*  
    my praise shall be always of you.**
