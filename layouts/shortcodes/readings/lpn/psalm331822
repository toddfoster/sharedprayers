_Exultate, justi_

> 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, \*  
    on those who wait upon his love,  
> **19 To pluck their lives from death, \*  
    and to feed them in time of famine.**
  
> 20 Our soul waits for the LORD; \*  
    he is our help and our shield.  
> **21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, \*  
    for in his holy Name we put our trust.**
  
> 22 Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, \*  
    as we have put our trust in you.
