_Deus, Deus meus_

> 18 Be not far away, O LORD; \*  
 you are my strength; hasten to help me.  
> **19 Save me from the sword, \*  
 my life from the power of the dog.**
  
> 20 Save me from the lion's mouth, \*  
 my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.  
> **21 I will declare your Name to my brethren; \*  
 in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.**
  
> 22 Praise the LORD, you that fear him; \*  
 stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;
 all you of Jacob's line, give glory.  
> **23 For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;
 neither does he hide his face from them; \*  
 but when they cry to him he hears them.**
  
> 24 My praise is of him in the great assembly; \*  
 I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.  
> **25 The poor shall eat and be satisfied,
 and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: \*  
 "May your heart live for ever!"**
  
> 26 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, \*  
 and all the families of the nations shall bow before him.  
> **27 For kingship belongs to the LORD; \*  
 he rules over the nations.**
