Thus says the Lord:

> "Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; 
> rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her-- 
> that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; 
> that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious bosom.

For thus says the LORD:

> I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; 
> and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm, and dandled on her knees. 
> As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
> You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bodies shall flourish like the grass; 
> and it shall be known that the hand of the LORD is with his servants, and his indignation is against his enemies."
