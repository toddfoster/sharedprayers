_Exaudi, Domine_

> 1 Hear my plea of innocence, O LORD;
 give heed to my cry; \*  
 listen to my prayer, which does not come from lying lips.  
> **2 Let my vindication come forth from your presence; \*  
 let your eyes be fixed on justice.**
  
> 3 Weigh my heart, summon me by night, \*  
 melt me down; you will find no impurity in me.  
> **4 I give no offense with my mouth as others do; \*  
 I have heeded the words of your lips.**
  
> 5 My footsteps hold fast to the ways of your law; \*  
 in your paths my feet shall not stumble.  
> **6 I call upon you, O God, for you will answer me; \*  
 incline your ear to me and hear my words.**
  
> 7 Show me your marvelous loving-kindness, \*  
 O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand
 from those who rise up against them.  
> **8 Keep me as the apple of your eye; \*  
 hide me under the shadow of your wings,**
  
> 9 From the wicked who assault me, \*  
 from my deadly enemies who surround me.
