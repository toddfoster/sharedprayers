> Hannah prayed and said,
> “My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in my God. 
> There is no Holy One like the LORD, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. 
> Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; 
> for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 
> The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength. 
> Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil. 
> The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn. 
> The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up. 
> The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.
> He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap,
> to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. 
> For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world. 
> He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail. 
> The LORD! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven. 
> The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.”
