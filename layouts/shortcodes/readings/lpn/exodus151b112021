> “I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he has thrown into the sea. 
> The LORD is my strength and my might, and he has become my salvation; 
> this is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
> The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name. 
> “Pharaoh's chariots and his army he cast into the sea; his picked officers were sunk in the Red Sea. 
> The floods covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone. 
> Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power-- your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy. 
> In the greatness of your majesty you overthrew your adversaries; you sent out your fury, it consumed them like stubble.
> At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up, the floods stood up in a heap; the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea. 
> The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my desire shall have its fill of them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’ 
> You blew with your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters. 
> “Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, doing wonders?”

Then the prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.

And Miriam sang to them:

> “Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he has thrown into the sea.”
