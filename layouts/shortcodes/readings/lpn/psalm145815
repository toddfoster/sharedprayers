and your faithful servants bless you.

and speak of your power;**
  
> 12 That the peoples may know of your power \*  
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.  
> **13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; \*  
your dominion endures throughout all ages.**

and merciful in all his deeds.

he lifts up those who are bowed down.**
