_Mirabilia_

> 129 Your decrees are wonderful; \*  
therefore I obey them with all my heart.  
> **130 When your word goes forth it gives light; \*  
it gives understanding to the simple.**
  
> 131 I open my mouth and pant; \*  
I long for your commandments.  
> **132 Turn to me in mercy, \*  
as you always do to those who love your Name.**
  
> 133 Steady my footsteps in your word; \*  
let no iniquity have dominion over me.  
> **134 Rescue me from those who oppress me, \*  
and I will keep your commandments.**
  
> 135 Let your countenance shine upon your servant \*  
and teach me your statutes.  
> **136 My eyes shed streams of tears, \*  
because people do not keep your law.**
