_Justus es, Domine_

> 137 You are righteous, O LORD, \*  
and upright are your judgments.  
> **138 You have issued your decrees \*  
with justice and in perfect faithfulness.**
  
> 139 My indignation has consumed me, \*  
because my enemies forget your words.  
> **140 Your word has been tested to the uttermost, \*  
and your servant holds it dear.**
  
> 141 I am small and of little account, \*  
yet I do not forget your commandments.  
> **142 Your justice is an everlasting justice \*  
and your law is the truth.**
  
> 143 Trouble and distress have come upon me, \*  
yet your commandments are my delight.  
> **144 The righteousness of your decrees is everlasting; \*  
grant me understanding, that I may live.**
