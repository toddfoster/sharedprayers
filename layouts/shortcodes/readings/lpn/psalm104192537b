_Benedic, anima mea_

> 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul; \*  
O LORD my God, how excellent is your greatness!
you are clothed with majesty and splendor.  
> **2 You wrap yourself with light as with a cloak \*  
and spread out the heavens like a curtain.**
  
> 3 You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters above; \*  
you make the clouds your chariot;
you ride on the wings of the wind.  
> **4 You make the winds your messengers \*  
and flames of fire your servants.**
  
> 5 You have set the earth upon its foundations, \*  
so that it never shall move at any time.  
> **6 You covered it with the Deep as with a mantle; \*  
the waters stood higher than the mountains.**
  
> 7 At your rebuke they fled; \*  
at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.  
> **8 They went up into the hills and down to the valleys beneath, \*  
to the places you had appointed for them.**
  
> 9 You set the limits that they should not pass; \*  
they shall not again cover the earth.  
> **25 O LORD, how manifold are your works! \*  
in wisdom you have made them all;
the earth is full of your creatures.**
  
> 37b Hallelujah!
