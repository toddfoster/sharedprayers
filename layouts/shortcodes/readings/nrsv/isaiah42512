 
> Thus says God, the Lord,
>    who created the heavens and stretched them out,
>    who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
> who gives breath to the people upon it
>    and spirit to those who walk in it: 
> I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,
>    I have taken you by the hand and kept you;
> I have given you as a covenant to the people,
>    a light to the nations, 
>    to open the eyes that are blind,
> to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
>    from the prison those who sit in darkness. 
> I am the Lord, that is my name;
>    my glory I give to no other,
>    nor my praise to idols. 
> See, the former things have come to pass,
>    and new things I now declare;
> before they spring forth,
>    I tell you of them.

 
> Sing to the Lord a new song,
>    his praise from the end of the earth!
> Let the sea roar and all that fills it,
>    the coastlands and their inhabitants. 
> Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice,
>    the villages that Kedar inhabits;
> let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy,
>    let them shout from the tops of the mountains. 
> Let them give glory to the Lord,
>    and declare his praise in the coastlands.
