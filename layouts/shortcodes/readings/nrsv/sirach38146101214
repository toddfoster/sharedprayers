Honour physicians for their services,
>    for the Lord created them; 
> for their gift of healing comes from the Most High,
>    and they are rewarded by the king. 
> The skill of physicians makes them distinguished,
>    and in the presence of the great they are admired. 
> The Lord created medicines out of the earth,
>    and the sensible will not despise them. 
> And he gave skill to human beings
>    that he might be glorified in his marvellous works. 
> By them the physician heals and takes away pain; 
>    the pharmacist makes a mixture from them.
> Godâ€™s works will never be finished;
>    and from him health spreads over all the earth.

 
> My child, when you are ill, do not delay,
>    but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you. 
> Give up your faults and direct your hands rightly,
>    and cleanse your heart from all sin. 
> Then give the physician his place, for the Lord created him;
>    do not let him leave you, for you need him. 
> There may come a time when recovery lies in the hands of physicians, 
>    for they too pray to the Lord
> that he will grant them success in diagnosis
>    and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.
