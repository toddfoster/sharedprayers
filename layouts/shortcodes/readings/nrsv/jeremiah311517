 
> Thus says the Lord:
> A voice is heard in Ramah,
>    lamentation and bitter weeping.
> Rachel is weeping for her children;
>    she refuses to be comforted for her children,
>    because they are no more. 
> Thus says the Lord:
> Keep your voice from weeping,
>    and your eyes from tears;
> for there is a reward for your work,

says the Lord:
>    they shall come back from the land of the enemy; 
> there is hope for your future,

says the Lord:
>    your children shall come back to their own country.
