 
> I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
>    my whole being shall exult in my God;
> for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
>    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
> as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
>    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 
> For as the earth brings forth its shoots,
>    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,
> so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise
>    to spring up before all the nations.

For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,
>    and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
> until her vindication shines out like the dawn,
>    and her salvation like a burning torch. 
> The nations shall see your vindication,
>    and all the kings your glory;
> and you shall be called by a new name
>    that the mouth of the Lord will give. 
> You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,
>    and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
