> The wild animals will honour me,

> Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;
>    but you have been weary of me, O Israel! 
> You have not brought me your sheep for burnt-offerings,
>    or honoured me with your sacrifices.
> I have not burdened you with offerings,
>    or wearied you with frankincense. 
> You have not bought me sweet cane with money,
>    or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
> But you have burdened me with your sins;
>    you have wearied me with your iniquities.

 
> I, I am He
>    who blots out your transgressions for my own sake,
>    and I will not remember your sins.
