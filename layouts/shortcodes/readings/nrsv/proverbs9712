> Whoever corrects a scoffer wins abuse;
>    whoever rebukes the wicked gets hurt.
> A scoffer who is rebuked will only hate you;
>    the wise, when rebuked, will love you.
> Give instruction to the wise, and they will become wiser still;
>    teach the righteous and they will gain in learning.
> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
>    and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
> For by me your days will be multiplied,
>    and years will be added to your life.
> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
>    if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
