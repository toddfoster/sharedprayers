Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind: 
> ‘Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? 
> Gird up your loins like a man,
>    I will question you, and you shall declare to me.

 
> ‘Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
>    Tell me, if you have understanding. 
> Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
>    Or who stretched the line upon it? 
> On what were its bases sunk,
>    or who laid its cornerstone 
> when the morning stars sang together
>    and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?

 
> ‘Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
>    so that a flood of waters may cover you? 
> Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go
>    and say to you, “Here we are”? 
> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts,
>    or given understanding to the mind? 
> Who has the wisdom to number the clouds?
>    Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens, 
> when the dust runs into a mass
>    and the clods cling together?

 
> ‘Can you hunt the prey for the lion,
>    or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 
> when they crouch in their dens,
>    or lie in wait in their covert? 
> Who provides for the raven its prey,
>    when its young ones cry to God,
>    and wander about for lack of food?
