Wisdom has built her house,
>    she has hewn her seven pillars. 
> She has slaughtered her animals, she has mixed her wine,
>    she has also set her table. 
> She has sent out her servant-girls, she calls
>    from the highest places in the town, 
> ‘You that are simple, turn in here!’
>    To those without sense she says, 
> ‘Come, eat of my bread
>    and drink of the wine I have mixed. 
> Lay aside immaturity, and live,
>    and walk in the way of insight.’
