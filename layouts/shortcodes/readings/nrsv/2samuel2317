Now these are the last words of David:
> The oracle of David, son of Jesse,
>    the oracle of the man whom God exalted,
> the anointed of the God of Jacob,
>    the favourite of the Strong One of Israel:

 
> The spirit of the Lord speaks through me,
>    his word is upon my tongue. 
> The God of Israel has spoken,
>    the Rock of Israel has said to me:
> One who rules over people justly,
>    ruling in the fear of God, 
> is like the light of morning,
>    like the sun rising on a cloudless morning,
>    gleaming from the rain on the grassy land.

 
> Is not my house like this with God?
>    For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,
>    ordered in all things and secure.
> Will he not cause to prosper
>    all my help and my desire? 
> But the godless are all like thorns that are thrown away;
>    for they cannot be picked up with the hand; 
> to touch them one uses an iron bar
>    or the shaft of a spear.
>    And they are entirely consumed in fire on the spot.
