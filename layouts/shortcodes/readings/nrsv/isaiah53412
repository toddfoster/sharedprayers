 
> Surely he has borne our infirmities
>    and carried our diseases;
> yet we accounted him stricken,
>    struck down by God, and afflicted. 
> But he was wounded for our transgressions,
>    crushed for our iniquities;
> upon him was the punishment that made us whole,
>    and by his bruises we are healed. 
> All we like sheep have gone astray;
>    we have all turned to our own way,
> and the Lord has laid on him
>    the iniquity of us all.

 
> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
>    yet he did not open his mouth;
> like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
>    and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
>    so he did not open his mouth. 
> By a perversion of justice he was taken away.
>    Who could have imagined his future?
> For he was cut off from the land of the living,
>    stricken for the transgression of my people. 
> They made his grave with the wicked
>    and his tomb with the rich,
> although he had done no violence,
>    and there was no deceit in his mouth.

 
> Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.
> When you make his life an offering for sin,
>    he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;
> through him the will of the Lord shall prosper. 
>    Out of his anguish he shall see light;
> he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.
>    The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,
>    and he shall bear their iniquities. 
> Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,
>    and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
> because he poured out himself to death,
>    and was numbered with the transgressors;
> yet he bore the sin of many,
>    and made intercession for the transgressors.
