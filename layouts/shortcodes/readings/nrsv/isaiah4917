Listen to me, O coastlands,
>    pay attention, you peoples from far away!
> The Lord called me before I was born,
>    while I was in my mother’s womb he named me. 
> He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
>    in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
> he made me a polished arrow,
>    in his quiver he hid me away. 
> And he said to me, ‘You are my servant,
>    Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’ 
> But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain,
>    I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
> yet surely my cause is with the Lord,
>    and my reward with my God.’

 
> And now the Lord says,
>    who formed me in the womb to be his servant,
> to bring Jacob back to him,
>    and that Israel might be gathered to him,
> for I am honoured in the sight of the Lord,
>    and my God has become my strength— 
> he says,
> ‘It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
>    to raise up the tribes of Jacob
>    and to restore the survivors of Israel;
> I will give you as a light to the nations,
>    that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.’

 
> Thus says the Lord,
>    the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
> to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,
>    the slave of rulers,
> ‘Kings shall see and stand up,
>    princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,
> because of the Lord, who is faithful,
>    the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.’
