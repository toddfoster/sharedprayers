Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
>    let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 
> May my teaching drop like the rain,
>    my speech condense like the dew;
> like gentle rain on grass,
>    like showers on new growth. 
> For I will proclaim the name of the Lord;
>    ascribe greatness to our God!

 
> The Rock, his work is perfect,
>    and all his ways are just.
> A faithful God, without deceit,
>    just and upright is he;
