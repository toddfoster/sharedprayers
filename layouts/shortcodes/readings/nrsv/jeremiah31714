 
> For thus says the Lord:
> Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob,
>    and raise shouts for the chief of the nations;
> proclaim, give praise, and say,
>    ‘Save, O Lord, your people,
>    the remnant of Israel.’ 
> See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north,
>    and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,
> among them the blind and the lame,
>    those with child and those in labour, together;
>    a great company, they shall return here. 
> With weeping they shall come,
>    and with consolations I will lead them back,
> I will let them walk by brooks of water,
>    in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;
> for I have become a father to Israel,
>    and Ephraim is my firstborn.

 
> Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,
>    and declare it in the coastlands far away;
> say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,
>    and will keep him as a shepherd a flock.’ 
> For the Lord has ransomed Jacob,
>    and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him. 
> They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,
>    and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the Lord,
> over the grain, the wine, and the oil,
>    and over the young of the flock and the herd;
> their life shall become like a watered garden,
>    and they shall never languish again. 
> Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance,
>    and the young men and the old shall be merry.
> I will turn their mourning into joy,
>    I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow. 
> I will give the priests their fill of fatness,
>    and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty,

says the Lord.
