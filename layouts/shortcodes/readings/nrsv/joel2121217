Blow the trumpet in Zion;
>    sound the alarm on my holy mountain!
> Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
>    for the day of the Lord is coming, it is near— 
> a day of darkness and gloom,
>    a day of clouds and thick darkness!
> Like blackness spread upon the mountains
>    a great and powerful army comes;
> their like has never been from of old,
>    nor will be again after them
>    in ages to come.

 
> Yet even now, says the Lord,
>    return to me with all your heart,
> with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; 
>    rend your hearts and not your clothing.
> Return to the Lord, your God,
>    for he is gracious and merciful,
> slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love,
>    and relents from punishing. 
> Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,
>    and leave a blessing behind him,
> a grain-offering and a drink-offering
>    for the Lord, your God?

 
> Blow the trumpet in Zion;
>    sanctify a fast;
> call a solemn assembly; 
>    gather the people.
> Sanctify the congregation;
>    assemble the aged;
> gather the children,
>    even infants at the breast.
> Let the bridegroom leave his room,
>    and the bride her canopy.

 
> Between the vestibule and the altar
>    let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep.
> Let them say, ‘Spare your people, O Lord,
>    and do not make your heritage a mockery,
>    a byword among the nations.
> Why should it be said among the peoples,
>    “Where is their God?”’
