> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad,
>    the desert shall rejoice and blossom;
> like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly,
>    and rejoice with joy and singing.
> The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,
>    the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
> They shall see the glory of the Lord,
>    the majesty of our God.
> 
> Strengthen the weak hands,
>   and make firm the feeble knees.
> Say to those who are of a fearful heart,
>    ‘Be strong, do not fear!
> Here is your God.
>    He will come with vengeance,
> with terrible recompense.
>    He will come and save you.’
 
> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
>    and the ears of the deaf unstopped; 
> then the lame shall leap like a deer,
>    and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy.
> For waters shall break forth in the wilderness,
>    and streams in the desert; 
> the burning sand shall become a pool,
>    and the thirsty ground springs of water;
> the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp,
>    the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
