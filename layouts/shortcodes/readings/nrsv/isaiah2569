 
> On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples
>    a feast of rich food, a feast of well-matured wines,
>    of rich food filled with marrow, of well-matured wines strained clear. 
> And he will destroy on this mountain
>    the shroud that is cast over all peoples,
>    the sheet that is spread over all nations; 
> he will swallow up death for ever.
> Then the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces,
>    and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth,
>    for the Lord has spoken. 
> It will be said on that day,
>    Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us.
>    This is the Lord for whom we have waited;
>    let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
