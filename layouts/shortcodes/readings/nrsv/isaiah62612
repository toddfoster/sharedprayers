 
> Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,
>    I have posted sentinels;
> all day and all night
>    they shall never be silent.
> You who remind the Lord,
>    take no rest, 
> and give him no rest
>    until he establishes Jerusalem
>    and makes it renowned throughout the earth. 
> The Lord has sworn by his right hand
>    and by his mighty arm:
> I will not again give your grain
>    to be food for your enemies,
> and foreigners shall not drink the wine
>    for which you have laboured; 
> but those who garner it shall eat it
>    and praise the Lord,
> and those who gather it shall drink it
>    in my holy courts.

 
> Go through, go through the gates,
>    prepare the way for the people;
> build up, build up the highway,
>    clear it of stones,
>    lift up an ensign over the peoples. 
> The Lord has proclaimed
>    to the end of the earth:
> Say to daughter Zion,
>    ‘See, your salvation comes;
> his reward is with him,
>    and his recompense before him.’ 
> They shall be called, ‘The Holy People,
>    The Redeemed of the Lord’;
> and you shall be called, ‘Sought Out,
>    A City Not Forsaken.’
