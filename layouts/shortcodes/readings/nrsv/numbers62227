The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the Israelites: You shall say to them, 
> The Lord bless you and keep you; 
> the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you; 
> the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.

So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.
