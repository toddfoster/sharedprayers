>    be glad and rejoice,
>    for the Lord has done great things! 
> Do not fear, you animals of the field,
>    for the pastures of the wilderness are green;
> the tree bears its fruit,
>    the fig tree and vine give their full yield.

 
> O children of Zion, be glad
>    and rejoice in the Lord your God;
> for he has given the early rain for your vindication,
>    he has poured down for you abundant rain,
>    the early and the later rain, as before. 
> The threshing-floors shall be full of grain,
>    the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

 
> I will repay you for the years
>    that the swarming locust has eaten,
> the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter,
>    my great army, which I sent against you.

 
> You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
>    and praise the name of the Lord your God,
>    who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame. 
> You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel,
>    and that I, the Lord, am your God and there is no other.
> And my people shall never again
>    be put to shame.
