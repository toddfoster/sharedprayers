 
> See, my servant shall prosper;
>    he shall be exalted and lifted up,
>    and shall be very high. 
> Just as there were many who were astonished at him
>    —so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance,
>    and his form beyond that of mortals— 
> so he shall startle many nations;
>    kings shall shut their mouths because of him;
> for that which had not been told them they shall see,
>    and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.

Who has believed what we have heard?
>    And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
> For he grew up before him like a young plant,
>    and like a root out of dry ground;
> he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,
>    nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. 
> He was despised and rejected by others;
>    a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;
> and as one from whom others hide their faces
>    he was despised, and we held him of no account.

 
> Surely he has borne our infirmities
>    and carried our diseases;
> yet we accounted him stricken,
>    struck down by God, and afflicted. 
> But he was wounded for our transgressions,
>    crushed for our iniquities;
> upon him was the punishment that made us whole,
>    and by his bruises we are healed. 
> All we like sheep have gone astray;
>    we have all turned to our own way,
> and the Lord has laid on him
>    the iniquity of us all.

 
> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
>    yet he did not open his mouth;
> like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
>    and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
>    so he did not open his mouth. 
> By a perversion of justice he was taken away.
>    Who could have imagined his future?
> For he was cut off from the land of the living,
>    stricken for the transgression of my people. 
> They made his grave with the wicked
>    and his tomb with the rich,
> although he had done no violence,
>    and there was no deceit in his mouth.

 
> Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.
> When you make his life an offering for sin,
>    he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;
> through him the will of the Lord shall prosper. 
>    Out of his anguish he shall see light;
> he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.
>    The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,
>    and he shall bear their iniquities. 
> Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,
>    and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
> because he poured out himself to death,
>    and was numbered with the transgressors;
> yet he bore the sin of many,
>    and made intercession for the transgressors.
