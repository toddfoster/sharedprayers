And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,
> ‘Now have come the salvation and the power
>    and the kingdom of our God
>    and the authority of his Messiah,
> for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down,
>    who accuses them day and night before our God. 
> But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb
>    and by the word of their testimony,
> for they did not cling to life even in the face of death. 
> Rejoice then, you heavens
>    and those who dwell in them!
> But woe to the earth and the sea,
>    for the devil has come down to you
> with great wrath,
>    because he knows that his time is short!’
