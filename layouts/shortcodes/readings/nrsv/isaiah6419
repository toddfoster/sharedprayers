O that you would tear open the heavens and come down,
>    so that the mountains would quake at your presence— 
> as when fire kindles brushwood
>    and the fire causes water to boil—
> to make your name known to your adversaries,
>    so that the nations might tremble at your presence! 
> When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect,
>    you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence. 
> From ages past no one has heard,
>    no ear has perceived,
> no eye has seen any God besides you,
>    who works for those who wait for him. 
> You meet those who gladly do right,
>    those who remember you in your ways.
> But you were angry, and we sinned;
>    because you hid yourself we transgressed. 
> We have all become like one who is unclean,
>    and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.
> We all fade like a leaf,
>    and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 
> There is no one who calls on your name,
>    or attempts to take hold of you;
> for you have hidden your face from us,
>    and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity. 
> Yet, O Lord, you are our Father;
>    we are the clay, and you are our potter;
>    we are all the work of your hand. 
> Do not be exceedingly angry, O Lord,
>    and do not remember iniquity for ever.
>    Now consider, we are all your people.
