Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind: 
> ‘Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? 
> Gird up your loins like a man,
>    I will question you, and you shall declare to me.

 
> ‘Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
>    Tell me, if you have understanding. 
> Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
>    Or who stretched the line upon it? 
> On what were its bases sunk,
>    or who laid its cornerstone 
> when the morning stars sang together
>    and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?

 
> ‘Or who shut in the sea with doors
>    when it burst out from the womb?— 
> when I made the clouds its garment,
>    and thick darkness its swaddling band, 
> and prescribed bounds for it,
>    and set bars and doors, 
> and said, “Thus far shall you come, and no farther,
>    and here shall your proud waves be stopped”?
