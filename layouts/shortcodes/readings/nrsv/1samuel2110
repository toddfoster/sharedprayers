Hannah prayed and said,
> ‘My heart exults in the Lord;
>    my strength is exalted in my God.
> My mouth derides my enemies,
>    because I rejoice in my victory.

 
> ‘There is no Holy One like the Lord,
>    no one besides you;
>    there is no Rock like our God. 
> Talk no more so very proudly,
>    let not arrogance come from your mouth;
> for the Lord is a God of knowledge,
>    and by him actions are weighed. 
> The bows of the mighty are broken,
>    but the feeble gird on strength. 
> Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,
>    but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.
> The barren has borne seven,
>    but she who has many children is forlorn. 
> The Lord kills and brings to life;
>    he brings down to Sheol and raises up. 
> The Lord makes poor and makes rich;
>    he brings low, he also exalts. 
> He raises up the poor from the dust;
>    he lifts the needy from the ash heap,
> to make them sit with princes
>    and inherit a seat of honour.
> For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s,
>    and on them he has set the world.

 
> ‘He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,
>    but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness;
>    for not by might does one prevail. 
> The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered;
>    the Most High will thunder in heaven.
> The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;
>    he will give strength to his king,
>    and exalt the power of his anointed.’
