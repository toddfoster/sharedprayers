Here is my servant, whom I uphold,
>    my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
> I have put my spirit upon him;
>    he will bring forth justice to the nations. 
> He will not cry or lift up his voice,
>    or make it heard in the street; 
> a bruised reed he will not break,
>    and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;
>    he will faithfully bring forth justice. 
> He will not grow faint or be crushed
>    until he has established justice in the earth;
>    and the coastlands wait for his teaching.

 
> Thus says God, the Lord,
>    who created the heavens and stretched them out,
>    who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
> who gives breath to the people upon it
>    and spirit to those who walk in it: 
> I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,
>    I have taken you by the hand and kept you;
> I have given you as a covenant to the people,
>    a light to the nations, 
>    to open the eyes that are blind,
> to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
>    from the prison those who sit in darkness. 
> I am the Lord, that is my name;
>    my glory I give to no other,
>    nor my praise to idols. 
> See, the former things have come to pass,
>    and new things I now declare;
> before they spring forth,
>    I tell you of them.
