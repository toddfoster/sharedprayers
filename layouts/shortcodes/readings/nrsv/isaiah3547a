>    ‘Be strong, do not fear!
> Here is your God.
>    He will come with vengeance,
> with terrible recompense.
>    He will come and save you.’

 
> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
>    and the ears of the deaf unstopped; 
> then the lame shall leap like a deer,
>    and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy.
> For waters shall break forth in the wilderness,
>    and streams in the desert; 
> the burning sand shall become a pool,
>    and the thirsty ground springs of water;
> the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp,
>    the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
