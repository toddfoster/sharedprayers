Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, ‘Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?’ I said to him, ‘Sir, you are the one that knows.’ Then he said to me, ‘These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
> For this reason they are before the throne of God,
>    and worship him day and night within his temple,
>    and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them. 
> They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;
>    the sun will not strike them,
>    nor any scorching heat; 
> for the Lamb at the centre of the throne will be their shepherd,
>    and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’
