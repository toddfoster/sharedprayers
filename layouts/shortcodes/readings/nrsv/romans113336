O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgements and how inscrutable his ways!
> ‘For who has known the mind of the Lord?
>   Or who has been his counsellor?’
> ‘Or who has given a gift to him,
>   to receive a gift in return?’

For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.
