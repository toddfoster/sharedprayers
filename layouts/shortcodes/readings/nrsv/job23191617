Then Job answered: 
> ‘Today also my complaint is bitter;
>    his hand is heavy despite my groaning. 
> O that I knew where I might find him,
>    that I might come even to his dwelling! 
> I would lay my case before him,
>    and fill my mouth with arguments. 
> I would learn what he would answer me,
>    and understand what he would say to me. 
> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
>    No; but he would give heed to me. 
> There an upright person could reason with him,
>    and I should be acquitted for ever by my judge.

 
> ‘If I go forward, he is not there;
>    or backward, I cannot perceive him; 
> on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him;
>    I turn to the right, but I cannot see him. 
> God has made my heart faint;
>    the Almighty has terrified me; 
> If only I could vanish in darkness,
>    and thick darkness would cover my face!
