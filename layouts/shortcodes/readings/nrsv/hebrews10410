 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,
> ‘Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,
>    but a body you have prepared for me; 
> in burnt-offerings and sin-offerings
>    you have taken no pleasure. 
> Then I said, “See, God, I have come to do your will, O God”
>    (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).’ 
> When he said above, ‘You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sin-offerings’ (these are offered according to the law), then he added, ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
