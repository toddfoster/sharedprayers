The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
>    because the Lord has anointed me;
> he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed,
>    to bind up the broken-hearted,
> to proclaim liberty to the captives,
>    and release to the prisoners; 
> to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour,
>    and the day of vengeance of our God;
>    to comfort all who mourn; 
> to provide for those who mourn in Zion—
>    to give them a garland instead of ashes,
> the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
>    the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.
> They will be called oaks of righteousness,
>    the planting of the Lord, to display his glory. 
> They shall build up the ancient ruins,
>    they shall raise up the former devastations;
> they shall repair the ruined cities,
>    the devastations of many generations.

 
> For I the Lord love justice,
>    I hate robbery and wrongdoing;
> I will faithfully give them their recompense,
>    and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. 
> Their descendants shall be known among the nations,
>    and their offspring among the peoples;
> all who see them shall acknowledge
>    that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed. 
> I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
>    my whole being shall exult in my God;
> for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
>    he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
> as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
>    and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. 
> For as the earth brings forth its shoots,
>    and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,
> so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise
>    to spring up before all the nations.
