 
> The voice of my beloved!
>    Look, he comes,
> leaping upon the mountains,
>    bounding over the hills. 
> My beloved is like a gazelle
>    or a young stag.
> Look, there he stands
>    behind our wall,
> gazing in at the windows,
>    looking through the lattice. 
> My beloved speaks and says to me:
> â€˜Arise, my love, my fair one,
>    and come away; 
> for now the winter is past,
>    the rain is over and gone. 
> The flowers appear on the earth;
>    the time of singing has come,
> and the voice of the turtle-dove
>    is heard in our land. 
> The fig tree puts forth its figs,
>    and the vines are in blossom;
>    they give forth fragrance.
> Arise, my love, my fair one,
>    and come away.
