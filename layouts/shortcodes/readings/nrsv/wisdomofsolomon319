But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,
> and no torment will ever touch them. 
> In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died,
> and their departure was thought to be a disaster, 
> and their going from us to be their destruction;
> but they are at peace. 
> For though in the sight of others they were punished,
> their hope is full of immortality. 
> Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good,
> because God tested them and found them worthy of himself; 
> like gold in the furnace he tried them,
> and like a sacrificial burnt-offering he accepted them. 
> In the time of their visitation they will shine forth,
> and will run like sparks through the stubble. 
> They will govern nations and rule over peoples,
> and the Lord will reign over them for ever. 
> Those who trust in him will understand truth,
> and the faithful will abide with him in love,
> because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones,
> and he watches over his elect.
