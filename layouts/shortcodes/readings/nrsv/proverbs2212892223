A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
>    and favour is better than silver or gold. 
> The rich and the poor have this in common:
>    the Lord is the maker of them all. 
> Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity,
>    and the rod of anger will fail. 
> Those who are generous are blessed,
>    for they share their bread with the poor. 
> Do not rob the poor because they are poor,
>    or crush the afflicted at the gate; 
> for the Lord pleads their cause
>    and despoils of life those who despoil them.
