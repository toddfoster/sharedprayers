Arise, shine; for your light has come,
>    and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. 
> For darkness shall cover the earth,
>    and thick darkness the peoples;
> but the Lord will arise upon you,
>    and his glory will appear over you. 
> Nations shall come to your light,
>    and kings to the brightness of your dawn.

 
> Lift up your eyes and look around;
>    they all gather together, they come to you;
> your sons shall come from far away,
>    and your daughters shall be carried on their nursesâ€™ arms. 
> Then you shall see and be radiant;
>    your heart shall thrill and rejoice,
> because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you,
>    the wealth of the nations shall come to you. 
> A multitude of camels shall cover you,
>    the young camels of Midian and Ephah;
>    all those from Sheba shall come.
> They shall bring gold and frankincense,
>    and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.
