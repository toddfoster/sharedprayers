> you have planted pleasant vineyards,
>    but you shall not drink their wine. 
> For I know how many are your transgressions,

> you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,
>    and push aside the needy in the gate. 
> Therefore the prudent will keep silent in such a time;
>    for it is an evil time.

 
> Seek good and not evil,

> Hate evil and love good,
