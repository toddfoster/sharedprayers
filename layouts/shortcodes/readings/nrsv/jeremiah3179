 
> For thus says the Lord:
> Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob,
>    and raise shouts for the chief of the nations;
> proclaim, give praise, and say,
>    ‘Save, O Lord, your people,
>    the remnant of Israel.’ 
> See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north,
>    and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,
> among them the blind and the lame,
>    those with child and those in labour, together;
>    a great company, they shall return here. 
> With weeping they shall come,
>    and with consolations I will lead them back,
> I will let them walk by brooks of water,
>    in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;
> for I have become a father to Israel,
>    and Ephraim is my firstborn.
