Comfort, O comfort my people,
>    says your God. 
> Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
>    and cry to her
> that she has served her term,
>    that her penalty is paid,
> that she has received from the Lord’s hand
>    double for all her sins.

 
> A voice cries out:
> ‘In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord,
>    make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
> Every valley shall be lifted up,
>    and every mountain and hill be made low;
> the uneven ground shall become level,
>    and the rough places a plain. 
> Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
>    and all people shall see it together,
>    for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.’

 
> A voice says, ‘Cry out!’
>    And I said, ‘What shall I cry?’
> All people are grass,
>    their constancy is like the flower of the field. 
> The grass withers, the flower fades,
>    when the breath of the Lord blows upon it;
>    surely the people are grass. 
> The grass withers, the flower fades;
>    but the word of our God will stand for ever. 
> Get you up to a high mountain,
>    O Zion, herald of good tidings;
> lift up your voice with strength,
>    O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings,
>    lift it up, do not fear;
> say to the cities of Judah,
>    ‘Here is your God!’ 
> See, the Lord God comes with might,
>    and his arm rules for him;
> his reward is with him,
>    and his recompense before him. 
> He will feed his flock like a shepherd;
>    he will gather the lambs in his arms,
> and carry them in his bosom,
>    and gently lead the mother sheep.
