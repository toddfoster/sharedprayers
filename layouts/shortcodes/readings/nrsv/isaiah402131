>    Has it not been told you from the beginning?
>    Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
>    and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;
> who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
>    and spreads them like a tent to live in; 
> who brings princes to naught,
>    and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.

 
> Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,
>    scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,
> when he blows upon them, and they wither,
>    and the tempest carries them off like stubble.

 
> To whom then will you compare me,
>    or who is my equal? says the Holy One. 
> Lift up your eyes on high and see:
>    Who created these?
> He who brings out their host and numbers them,
>    calling them all by name;
> because he is great in strength,
>    mighty in power,
>    not one is missing.

 
> Why do you say, O Jacob,
>    and speak, O Israel,
> ‘My way is hidden from the Lord,
>    and my right is disregarded by my God’? 
> Have you not known? Have you not heard?
> The Lord is the everlasting God,
>    the Creator of the ends of the earth.
> He does not faint or grow weary;
>    his understanding is unsearchable. 
> He gives power to the faint,
>    and strengthens the powerless. 
> Even youths will faint and be weary,
>    and the young will fall exhausted; 
> but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength,
>    they shall mount up with wings like eagles,
> they shall run and not be weary,
>    they shall walk and not faint.
