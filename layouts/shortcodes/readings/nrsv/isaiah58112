Shout out, do not hold back!
>    Lift up your voice like a trumpet!
> Announce to my people their rebellion,
>    to the house of Jacob their sins. 
> Yet day after day they seek me
>    and delight to know my ways,
> as if they were a nation that practised righteousness
>    and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;
> they ask of me righteous judgements,
>    they delight to draw near to God. 
> ‘Why do we fast, but you do not see?
>    Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?’
> Look, you serve your own interest on your fast-day,
>    and oppress all your workers. 
> Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight
>    and to strike with a wicked fist.
> Such fasting as you do today
>    will not make your voice heard on high. 
> Is such the fast that I choose,
>    a day to humble oneself?
> Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush,
>    and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?
> Will you call this a fast,
>    a day acceptable to the Lord?

 
> Is not this the fast that I choose:
>    to loose the bonds of injustice,
>    to undo the thongs of the yoke,
> to let the oppressed go free,
>    and to break every yoke? 
> Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
>    and bring the homeless poor into your house;
> when you see the naked, to cover them,
>    and not to hide yourself from your own kin? 
> Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
>    and your healing shall spring up quickly;
> your vindicator shall go before you,
>    the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard. 
> Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;
>    you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.


> If you remove the yoke from among you,
>    the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, 
> if you offer your food to the hungry
>    and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,
> then your light shall rise in the darkness
>    and your gloom be like the noonday. 
> The Lord will guide you continually,
>    and satisfy your needs in parched places,
>    and make your bones strong;
> and you shall be like a watered garden,
>    like a spring of water,
>    whose waters never fail. 
> Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;
>    you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;
> you shall be called the repairer of the breach,
>    the restorer of streets to live in.
