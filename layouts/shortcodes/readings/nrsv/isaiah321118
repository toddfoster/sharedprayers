> Tremble, you women who are at ease,
>    shudder, you complacent ones;
> strip, and make yourselves bare,
>    and put sackcloth on your loins.
> Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
>    for the fruitful vine,
> for the soil of my people
>    growing up in thorns and briers;
> yes, for all the joyous houses
>    in the jubilant city.
> For the palace will be forsaken,
>    the populous city deserted;
> the hill and the watch-tower
>    will become dens for ever,
> the joy of wild asses,
>    a pasture for flocks;
> until a spirit from on high is poured out on us,
>    and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
>    and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.
> 
> Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
>    and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
> The effect of righteousness will be peace,
>    and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust for ever.
> My people will abide in a peaceful habitation,
>    in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.
