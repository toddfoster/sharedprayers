And Mary said,
> ‘My soul magnifies the Lord, 
>    and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, 
> for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.
>    Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed; 
> for the Mighty One has done great things for me,
>    and holy is his name. 
> His mercy is for those who fear him
>    from generation to generation. 
> He has shown strength with his arm;
>    he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. 
> He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,
>    and lifted up the lowly; 
> he has filled the hungry with good things,
>    and sent the rich away empty. 
> He has helped his servant Israel,
>    in remembrance of his mercy, 
> according to the promise he made to our ancestors,
>    to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.’
