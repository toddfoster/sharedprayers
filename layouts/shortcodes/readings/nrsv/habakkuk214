I will stand at my watch-post,
>    and station myself on the rampart;
> I will keep watch to see what he will say to me,
>    and what he will answer concerning my complaint. 
> Then the Lord answered me and said:
> Write the vision;
>    make it plain on tablets,
>    so that a runner may read it. 
> For there is still a vision for the appointed time;
>    it speaks of the end, and does not lie.
> If it seems to tarry, wait for it;
>    it will surely come, it will not delay. 
> Look at the proud!
>    Their spirit is not right in them,
>    but the righteous live by their faith.
