So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,
> ‘You are my Son,
>    today I have begotten you’; 
> as he says also in another place,
> ‘You are a priest for ever,
>    according to the order of Melchizedek.’

In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
