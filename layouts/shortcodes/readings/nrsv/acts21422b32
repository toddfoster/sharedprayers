But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: ‘Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say.

‘You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know— this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,
> “I saw the Lord always before me,
>    for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken; 
> therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;
>    moreover, my flesh will live in hope. 
> For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,
>    or let your Holy One experience corruption. 
> You have made known to me the ways of life;
>    you will make me full of gladness with your presence.”

‘Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,
> “He was not abandoned to Hades,
>    nor did his flesh experience corruption.” 
> This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.
