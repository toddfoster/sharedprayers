‘A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble, 
>    comes up like a flower and withers,
>    flees like a shadow and does not last. 
> Do you fix your eyes on such a one?
>    Do you bring me into judgement with you? 
> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
>    No one can. 
> Since their days are determined,
>    and the number of their months is known to you,
>    and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass, 
> look away from them, and desist,
>    that they may enjoy, like labourers, their days.

 
> ‘For there is hope for a tree,
>    if it is cut down, that it will sprout again,
>    and that its shoots will not cease. 
> Though its root grows old in the earth,
>    and its stump dies in the ground, 
> yet at the scent of water it will bud
>    and put forth branches like a young plant. 
> But mortals die, and are laid low;
>    humans expire, and where are they? 
> As waters fail from a lake,
>    and a river wastes away and dries up, 
> so mortals lie down and do not rise again;
>    until the heavens are no more, they will not awake
>    or be roused out of their sleep. 
> O that you would hide me in Sheol,
>    that you would conceal me until your wrath is past,
>    that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me! 
> If mortals die, will they live again?
>    All the days of my service I would wait
>    until my release should come.
