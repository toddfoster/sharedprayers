After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,
> ‘Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!’ 
> And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God, singing,
> ‘Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom
> and thanksgiving and honour
> and power and might
> be to our God for ever and ever! Amen.’
