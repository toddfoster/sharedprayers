My child, do not forget my teaching,
>    but let your heart keep my commandments; 
> for length of days and years of life
>    and abundant welfare they will give you.

 
> Do not let loyalty and faithfulness forsake you;
>    bind them round your neck,
>    write them on the tablet of your heart. 
> So you will find favour and good repute
>    in the sight of God and of people.

 
> Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
>    and do not rely on your own insight. 
> In all your ways acknowledge him,
>    and he will make straight your paths.
