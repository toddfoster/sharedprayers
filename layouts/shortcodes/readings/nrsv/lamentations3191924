I am one who has seen affliction
>    under the rod of God’s wrath; 
> he has driven and brought me
>    into darkness without any light; 
> against me alone he turns his hand,
>    again and again, all day long.

 
> He has made my flesh and my skin waste away,
>    and broken my bones; 
> he has besieged and enveloped me
>    with bitterness and tribulation; 
> he has made me sit in darkness
>    like the dead of long ago.

 
> He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;
>    he has put heavy chains on me; 
> though I call and cry for help,
>    he shuts out my prayer; 
> he has blocked my ways with hewn stones,
>    he has made my paths crooked.

 
> The thought of my affliction and my homelessness
>    is wormwood and gall! 
> My soul continually thinks of it
>    and is bowed down within me. 
> But this I call to mind,
>    and therefore I have hope:

 
> The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases,
>    his mercies never come to an end; 
> they are new every morning;
>    great is your faithfulness. 
> ‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul,
>    ‘therefore I will hope in him.’
