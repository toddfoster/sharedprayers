> if you indeed cry out for insight,

> For the Lord gives wisdom;
>    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
> he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
>    he is a shield to those who walk blamelessly,
> guarding the paths of justice
>    and preserving the way of his faithful ones.
> Then you will understand righteousness and justice
>    and equity, every good path;
