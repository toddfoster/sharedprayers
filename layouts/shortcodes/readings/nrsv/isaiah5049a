> The Lord God has opened my ear,
>    and I was not rebellious,
>    I did not turn backwards. 
> I gave my back to those who struck me,

> The Lord God helps me;
>    therefore I have not been disgraced;
> therefore I have set my face like flint,
>    and I know that I shall not be put to shame; 
>    he who vindicates me is near.
> Who will contend with me?
>    Let us stand up together.
> Who are my adversaries?
>    Let them confront me. 
> It is the Lord God who helps me;
>    who will declare me guilty?
> All of them will wear out like a garment;
>    the moth will eat them up.
