Naomi said, ‘See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.’ But Ruth said,

> ‘Do not press me to leave you
>    or to turn back from following you!
> Where you go, I will go;
>    where you lodge, I will lodge;
> your people shall be my people,
>    and your God my God.
> Where you die, I will die—
>    there will I be buried.
> May the Lord do thus and so to me,
>    and more as well,
> if even death parts me from you!’

When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.
