Thus says the Lord God:
> I myself will take a sprig
>    from the lofty top of a cedar;
>    I will set it out.
> I will break off a tender one
>    from the topmost of its young twigs;
> I myself will plant it
>    on a high and lofty mountain. 
> On the mountain height of Israel
>    I will plant it,
> in order that it may produce boughs and bear fruit,
>    and become a noble cedar.
> Under it every kind of bird will live;
>    in the shade of its branches will nest
>    winged creatures of every kind. 
> All the trees of the field shall know
>    that I am the Lord.
> I bring low the high tree,
>    I make high the low tree;
> I dry up the green tree
>    and make the dry tree flourish.
> I the Lord have spoken;
>    I will accomplish it.
