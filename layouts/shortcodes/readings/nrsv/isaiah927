 
> The people who walked in darkness
>    have seen a great light;
> those who lived in a land of deep darknessâ€”
>    on them light has shined. 
> You have multiplied the nation,
>    you have increased its joy;
> they rejoice before you
>    as with joy at the harvest,
>    as people exult when dividing plunder. 
> For the yoke of their burden,
>    and the bar across their shoulders,
>    the rod of their oppressor,
>    you have broken as on the day of Midian. 
> For all the boots of the tramping warriors
>    and all the garments rolled in blood
>    shall be burned as fuel for the fire. 
> For a child has been born for us,
>    a son given to us;
> authority rests upon his shoulders;
>    and he is named
> Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
>    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 
> His authority shall grow continually,
>    and there shall be endless peace
> for the throne of David and his kingdom.
>    He will establish and uphold it
> with justice and with righteousness
>    from this time onwards and for evermore.
> The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
