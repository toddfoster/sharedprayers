 
> Wisdom cries out in the street;
>    in the squares she raises her voice. 
> At the busiest corner she cries out;
>    at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: 
> ‘How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?
> How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing
>    and fools hate knowledge? 
> Give heed to my reproof;
> I will pour out my thoughts to you;
>    I will make my words known to you. 
> Because I have called and you refused,
>    have stretched out my hand and no one heeded, 
> and because you have ignored all my counsel
>    and would have none of my reproof, 
> I also will laugh at your calamity;
>    I will mock when panic strikes you, 
> when panic strikes you like a storm,
>    and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
>    when distress and anguish come upon you. 
> Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
>    they will seek me diligently, but will not find me. 
> Because they hated knowledge
>    and did not choose the fear of the Lord, 
> would have none of my counsel,
>    and despised all my reproof, 
> therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way
>    and be sated with their own devices. 
> For waywardness kills the simple,
>    and the complacency of fools destroys them; 
> but those who listen to me will be secure
>    and will live at ease, without dread of disaster.’
