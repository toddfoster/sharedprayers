##### Especially suitable for use in Easter Season
##### **All:**
> **I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; \*
the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.
The Lord is my strength and my refuge; \*
the Lord has become my Savior.
This is my God and I will praise him, \*
the God of my people and I will exalt him.
The Lord is a mighty warrior; \*
Yahweh is his Name.
The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; \*
the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.
The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; \*
they sank into the depths like a stone.
Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; \*
your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.
Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? \*
who is like you, glorious in holiness,
awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?
You stretched forth your right hand; \*
the earth swallowed them up.
With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; \*
with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.
You will bring them in and plant them \*
on the mount of your possession,
The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, \*
the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.
The Lord shall reign \*
for ever and for ever.**

> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: \*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**
