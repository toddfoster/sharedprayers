**Canticle 11: The Third Song of Isaiah** -- _Surge, illuminare_ (Isaiah 60:1-3, 11a, 14c, 18-19) 
##### **All:**
**Arise, shine, for your light has come, \*
and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.
For behold, darkness covers the land; \*
deep gloom enshrouds the peoples.
But over you the Lord will rise, \*
and his glory will appear upon you.
Nations Will stream to your light, \*
and kings to the brightness of your dawning.
Your gates will always be open; \*
by day or night they will never be shut.
They will call you, The City of the Lord, \*
The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Violence will no more be heard in your land, \*
ruin or destruction within your borders.
You will call your walls, Salvation, \*
and all your portals, Praise.
The sun will no more be your light by day; \*
by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.
The Lord will be your everlasting light, \* and your God will be your glory.**

**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: \*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**
