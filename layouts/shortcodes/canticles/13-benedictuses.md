##### **All:**
**Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; \*
you are worthy of praise; glory to you.
Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; \*
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.**

**Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; \*
on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.
Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; \*
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.**

**Glory to you, beholding the depths; \*
in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.
Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; \*
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.**
