**Canticle 19: The Song of the Redeemed** -- _Magna et mirabilia_ (Revelation 15:3-4)
##### **All:**
**O ruler of the universe, Lord God,
great deeds are they that you have done, \*
surpassing human understanding.
Your ways are ways of righteousness and truth, \*
O King of all the ages.**

**Who can fail to do you homage, Lord,
and sing the praises of your Name? \*
for you only are the holy One.
All nations will draw near and fall down before you, \*
because your just and holy works have been revealed.**

**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: \*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**
