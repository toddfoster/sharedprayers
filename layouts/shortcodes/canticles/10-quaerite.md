**Canticle 10: The Second Song of Isaiah** -- _Quaerite Dominum_ (Isaiah 55:6-11) (BCP 86)
##### **All:**
**Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; \*
call upon him when he draws near.
Let the wicked forsake their ways \*
and the evil ones their thoughts;
And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, \*
and to our God, for he will richly pardon.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, \*
nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, \*
so are my ways higher than your ways,
and my thoughts than your thoughts.
For as rain and snow fall from the heavens \*
and return not again, but water the earth,
Bringing forth life and giving growth, \*
seed for sowing and bread for eating,
So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; \*
it will not return to me empty;
But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, \*
and prosper in that for which I sent it.**

**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: \*
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**
