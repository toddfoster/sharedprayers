**Canticle 18: A Song to the Lamb** -- _Dignus es_ (Rev. 4.11; 5.9--10, 13) (BCP 93)
**All:**
> **Splendor and honor and kingly power \*  
are yours by right, O Lord our God,  
For you created everything that is, \*  
and by your will they were created and have their being;**

> **And yours by right, O Lamb that was slain, \*  
for with your blood you have redeemed for God,  
From every family, language, people, and nation, \*  
a kingdom of priests to serve our God.**

> **And so, to him who sits upon the throne, \*  
and to Christ the Lamb,  
Be worship and praise, dominion and splendor, \*  
for ever and for evermore.**
