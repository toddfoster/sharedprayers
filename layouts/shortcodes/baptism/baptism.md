#### BCP 307
### The Baptism

##### Each candidate is presented by name to the Celebrant, or to an assisting priest or deacon, who then immerses, or pours water upon, the candidate, saying
_N.,_ I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

##### **People**
**Amen.**

##### When this action has been completed for all candidates, the Bishop or Priest, at a place in full sight of the congregation, prays over them, saying
Let us pray.

Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy
Spirit you have bestowed upon these your servants the
forgiveness of sin, and have raised them to the new life of
grace. Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit. Give them
an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to
persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy
and wonder in all your works.

##### **People**
**Amen.**

##### Then the Bishop or Priest places a hand on the person’s head, marking on the forehead the sign of the cross [using Chrism if desired] and saying to each one
_N.,_ you are sealed by the Holy Spirit in Baptism and marked as Christ’s own for ever.

##### **People**
**Amen.**

##### When all have been baptized, the Celebrant says
Let us welcome the newly baptized.

##### **Celebrant and People**
**We receive you into the household of God. Confess the faith of Christ crucified, proclaim his resurrection, and share with us in his eternal priesthood.**
