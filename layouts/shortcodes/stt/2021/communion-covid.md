**Receiving Communion during Covid:**

Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.

If you wish to receive communion physically:

1. Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)
2. Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.
3. Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.

##### If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)

If you do not wish to receive communion physically:

1. Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.
2. You are invited to utter the _Prayer for Spiritual Communion_ while communion is being distributed.

### Prayer for Spiritual Communion
> _In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen._
> (from _The Prayer Book for the Armed Services_)
