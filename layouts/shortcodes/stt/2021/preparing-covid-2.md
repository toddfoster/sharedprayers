## Preparing for the Liturgy

During this season of coronavirus infections, please demonstrate your love for your friends and neighbors by:

1. Wearing a mask (covering both mouth and nose)
2. Masks are optional outdoors or while leading liturgy (e.g., reading, preaching) _for those who have been "fully vaccinated"_
3. Remaining six feet apart from anyone we donâ€™t live with
4. Refraining from touching, hugging and shaking hands
5. Avoiding sharing common objects such as pens, paper, water bottles, etc.

If you are feeling ill or think you may have been exposed to someone ill within the last two weeks, _please stay home_ and participate with us online instead of in person.
