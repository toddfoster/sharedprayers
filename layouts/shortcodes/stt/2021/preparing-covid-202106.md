## Preparing for the Liturgy

During this season of coronavirus infections, please demonstrate your love for your friends and neighbors by wearing a mask (covering both mouth and nose) and maintaining six feet of social distancing from those not living in your house if you have not been vaccinated. Masks are optional for those who are _fully vaccinated._

If you are feeling ill or think you may have been exposed to someone ill within the last two weeks, _please stay home_ and participate with us online instead of in person.
