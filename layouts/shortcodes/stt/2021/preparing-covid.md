## Preparing for the Liturgy

During this season of coronavirus infections, please demonstrate your love for your friends and neighbors by wearing a mask (covering both mouth and nose) and maintaining six feet of social distancing from those not living in your house. If you have been _fully vaccinated_ then masks are optional _outdoors_ , at 15' of distance, while _leading liturgy_ (e.g., while serving as a lector).

If you are feeling ill or think you may have been exposed to someone ill within the last two weeks, _please stay home_ and participate with us online instead of in person.
