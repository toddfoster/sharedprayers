**Receiving Communion:**

_We will be offering communion with both Christâ€™s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine)._ (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey's Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)

_If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth._ (BCP, 457)

##### If you do not wish to receive communion physically, you are invited to utter the _Prayer for Spiritual Communion_ while communion is being distributed:

### Prayer for Spiritual Communion
_In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen._
(from _The Prayer Book for the Armed Services_)

##### The ministers receive the Sacrament in both kinds, and then immediately deliver it to the people. All are welcome to receive at Christ's table. If you would prefer to receive a verbal blessing instead of communion, cross your arms over your chest to indicate this.
