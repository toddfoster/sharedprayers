##### "If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth." (BCP, 457)

##### The ministers receive the Sacrament in both kinds, and then immediately deliver it to the people. All are welcome to receive at Christ's table. If you would prefer to receive a verbal blessing instead of communion, cross your arms over your chest to indicate this.
