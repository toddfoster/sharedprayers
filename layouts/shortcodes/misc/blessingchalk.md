##### Presider:
Our help is the name of the Lord:

##### **People:**
**The maker of heaven and earth.**

##### Presider:
The Lord shall watch over your going out and your coming in:

##### **People:**

The Lord be with you.

##### **People:**
**And also with you.**

##### Presider:
Let us pray.

Loving God, bless this chalk which you have created, that it may be helpful to your people; and grant that through the invocation of your most Holy Name all who use it in faith to write upon the doors of their homes the names of your saints, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, may receive health of body and protection of soul for all who dwell in or visit their home; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**
