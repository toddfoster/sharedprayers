This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.

The readings and collect for the daily office are helpfully assembled at [CommonPrayerOnline.org](https://www.commonprayeronline.org/en/daily-readings).

On Saturday nights of Sundays, if this service is taking the place of a Eucharist, one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary, which can be conveniently found at [lectionarypage.net](https://lectionarypage.net).

Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff.

If you don't have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on [oremus Bible Browser](http://bible.oremus.org/).

For the first collect, "Proper to the Day" (after the Suffrages), one may again use [lectionarypage.net](https://lectionarypage.net), the collect for the current (on weekdays, the preceding) Sunday.
