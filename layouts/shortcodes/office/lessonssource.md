This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.

The readings and collect(s) "proper to the day" for the daily office are helpfully assembled at [CommonPrayerOnline.org](https://www.commonprayeronline.org/en/readings/office).
If you don't have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on [oremus Bible Browser](http://bible.oremus.org/).

On Saturday nights or Sundays, if this service is taking the place of a Eucharist, one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary, which can be found at [lectionarypage.net](https://lectionarypage.net).

The official source of lessons for the daily office is in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff.
