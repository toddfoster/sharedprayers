### Christ our Passover _(Pascha nostrum)_
##### 1 Corinthians 5:7-8; Romans 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:20-22
##### **All:**
**Alleluia.
Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; \*
therefore let us keep the feast,
Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, \*
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.**

**Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; \*
death no longer has dominion over him.
The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; \*
but the life he lives, he lives to God.
So also consider yourselves dead to sin, \*
and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.**

**Christ has been raised from the dead, \*
the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For since by a man came death, \*
by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
For as in Adam all die, \*
so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.**
