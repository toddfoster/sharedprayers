### Jubilate _(Psalm 100)_
**All:**
> **Be joyful in the Lord, all you lands; *
	serve the Lord with gladness
	and come before his presence with a song.**

> **Know this: The Lord himself is God; *
	he himself has made us, and we are his;
	we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.**

> **Enter his gates with thanksgiving;
go into his courts with praise; *
	give thanks to him and call upon his Name.**

> **For the Lord is good;
his mercy is everlasting; *
	and his faithfulness endures from age to age.**
