### Psalm 95
##### **All:**
**Come, let us sing to the LORD; \*
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving \*
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.**

**For the LORD is a great God, \*
and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, \*
and the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it, \*
and his hands have molded the dry land.**

**Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, \*
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.
For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. \*
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!**

**Harden not your hearts,
as your forebears did in the wilderness, \*
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,
when they tempted me.
They put me to the test, \*
though they had seen my works.
Forty years long I detested that generation and said, \*
"This people are wayward in their hearts;
they do not know my ways."
So I swore in my wrath, \*
"They shall not enter into my rest."**
