##### The church is dark, or partially so, when the service is to begin.

##### All stand, and the Officiant greets the people with these words

#### BCP 109
##### Officiant:
Light and peace, in Jesus Christ our Lord.

##### **People:**
**Thanks be to God.**

##### Officiant:
Let us pray.

Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. 

##### **People:**
**Amen.**

##### The candles at the Altar are now lighted, as are other candles and lamps as may be convenient. During the candle-lighting silence is kept.
