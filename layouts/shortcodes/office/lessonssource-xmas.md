This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.

On Saturday nights of Sundays, if this service is taking the place of a Eucharist, one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary, which can be conveniently found at [lectionarypage.net](https://lectionarypage.net).

Lessons for the daily office during the Christmas season (12 days) can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 940f.

You will note that lessons are not provided on those pages for 26, 27, and 28 December. Those are feast days for St. Stephen, St. John, and the Holy Innocents, respectively. Their readings can be found in the BCP on page 996. To make things a little more confusing, if any of these three feasts occur on a Sunday, they are transferred to the nearest subsequent weekday. For example, in 2021, 26 December is a Sunday. So the feast of St. Stephen is transferred to 27 Dec, the feast of St. John to 28 Dec, and the feast of the Holy Innocents to 29 December. (Calendars will disagree among themselves about this.)

If you don't have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on [oremus Bible Browser](http://bible.oremus.org/).

For the first collect, "Proper to the Day" (after the Suffrages), one may again use [lectionarypage.net](https://lectionarypage.net), the collect for the current (on weekdays, the preceding) Sunday. In the BCP, Contemporary-language Collects are found on pp. 211ff. Collects for the three feasts following Christmas Day may be found on BCP pp. 237f.
