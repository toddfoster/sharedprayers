### The Post-communion Prayer
Presider:
> Let us pray.

**People:**
> **Almighty God, we thank you that
in your great love you have fed us
with the spiritual food and drink
of the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ,
and have given us a foretaste of your heavenly banquet.
Grant that this Sacrament may be to us
a comfort in affliction,
and a pledge of our inheritance
in that kingdom where there is no death,
neither sorrow nor crying,
but the fullness of joy with all your saints;
through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.**
