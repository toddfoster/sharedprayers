**Psalm 23** --- _Dominus regit me_ --- _(BCP 612)_
> **The Lord is my shepherd; *
I shall not be in want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures *
		and leads me beside still waters.
He revives my soul *
		and guides me along right pathways for his Nameâ€™s sake.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
			I shall fear no evil; *
		for you are with me;
			your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
You spread a table before me
			in the presence of those who trouble me; *
		you have anointed my head with oil,
			and my cup is running over.
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me
			all the days of my life, *
		and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.**
