##### Any remaining pledges may be brought up to the altar at this time.
_The Ingathering_
Oh Lord, giver of life and source of our freedom, we are reminded that Yours is “the earth in its fullness; the world and those who dwell in it.”  We know that it is from your hand that we have received all we have and are and will be.

Upon this altar today we lay our gifts, our pledges. These represent our selves, our substance, our sweat and tears, our dreams and aspirations. It is ourselves that we place upon this altar. Receive our gifts and our efforts to turn toward you. Speak to us in reply and teach us the path that you have laid before us. Use our gifts and use our selves to proclaim your love in thought, word and deed; at home, at work, at school, and at church. Teach us to be patient, to be merciful, to be generous, to be holy. Give us the wisdom to understand your dreams for our lives and the will to live into those dreams.

Bless, O Lord, our gifts and our giving, that we may be drawn into a more lively apprehension of your love for us and your present activity in our lives; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**
