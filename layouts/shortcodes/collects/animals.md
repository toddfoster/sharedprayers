##### (Robert Runcie, 102nd Archbishop of Canterbury)
O Lord, give us humility to thank you for the creation of animals, who can show affection which sometimes puts us to shame. Enlarge our respect for these your creatures, of whom we are the guardians. And gives us a sense of responsibility towards all your creation, for Jesus Christâ€™s sake.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**
