Loving God, we thank you for the ministries of Edward Thomas Demby and Henry Beard Delaney, bishops of your Church who, though limited by segregation, served faithfully to your honor and glory. Assis us, we pray, to break through the limitations of our own time, that we may minister in obedience to Jesus Christ; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, now and for ever.
