_God is Love, let heaven adore him_ (Hymnal 379)

> 1
God is Love: let heaven adore him;
God is Love: let earth rejoice;
let creation sing before him,
and exalt him with one voice.
God who laid the earth's foundation,
God who spread the heavens above,
God who breathes through all creation,
God is Love, eternal Love.

> 2
God is Love: and love enfolds us,
all the world in one embrace;
with unfailing grasp God holds us
every child of every race.
And when human hearts are breaking
under sorrow's iron rod,
then they find that selfsame aching
deep within the heart of God.

> 3
God is Love: and though with blindness
sin afflicts all human life,
God's eternal loving-kindness
guides us through our earthly strife.
Sin and death and hell shall never
o'er us final triumph gain;
God is Love, so Love for ever
o'er the universe must reign.
