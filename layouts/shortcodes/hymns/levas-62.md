_In Christ There Is No East or West_ (LEVAS 62)

> 1 In Christ there is no East or West,
in him no South or North,
but one great fellowship of love
throughout the whole wide earth.

> 2 In Christ shall true hearts ev’rywhere
their high communion find.
His service is the golden cord
close binding humankind.

> 3 Join hands, disciples of the faith,
whate’er your race may be.
Who serves my Father as a son
Is surely kin to me.

> 4 In Christ now meet both East and West,
in him meet South and North.
All Christly souls are one in him
throughout the whole wide earth.
