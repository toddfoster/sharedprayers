_O Christ, you are both light and day_ (Hymnal 40)

> 1
O Christ, you are both light and day,
you drive away the shadowed night;
as Day-star you precede the dawn,
the Herald of the light to come.

> 2
We pray you, O most holy Lord,
to be our guardian while we sleep;
bestow on us who rest in you
the blessing of a quiet night.

> 3
Although our eyes in sleep be closed,
let hearts in constant vigil watch;
with your right hand you will protect
those who believe and trust in you.

> 4
Defender of us all, look down;
repel our dread, malicious foe;
direct your faithful household, Lord,
whom you have purchased with your blood.

> 5
O Christ, Redeemer of the world,
O God, our Maker and our end,
O Spirit, bond of peace and love,
to you be thanks and endless praise.
