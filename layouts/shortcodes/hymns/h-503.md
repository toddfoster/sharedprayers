_Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire_ (Hymnal 503)

> 1 
Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,
**and lighten with celestial fire.**

> 2
Thou the anointing Spirit art,
**who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.**

> 3
Thy  blessed unction from above
**is comfort, life, and fire of love.**

> 4
Enable with perpetual light
**the dullness of our blinded sight.**

> 5
Anoint and cheer our soiled face
**with the abundance of thy grace.**

> 6
Keep far from foes, give peace at home:
**where thou art guide, no ill can come.**

> 7
Teach us to know the Father, Son,
**and thee, of both, to be but One,**

> 8
that through the ages all along,
**this may be our endless song:**

> 9
praise to thy eternal merit,
**Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.**
