_We walk by faith_ (Hymnal 209)

> 1
We walk by faith, and not by sight;
no gracious words we hear from him
who spoke as none e'er spoke;
but we believe him near.

> 2 
We may not touch his hands and side,
nor follow where he trod;
but in his promise we rejoice;
and cry, "My Lord and God!"

> 3 
Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;
and may our faith abound,
to call on you when you are near,
and seek where you are found:

> 4 
that, when our life of faith is done,
in realms of clearer light
we may behold you as you are,
with full and endless sight.
