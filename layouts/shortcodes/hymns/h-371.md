_Thou, whose almighty word_ (Hymnal 371)

> 1
Thou, whose almighty word
chaos and darkness heard,
and took their flight;
hear us, we humbly pray,
and, where the Gospel day
sheds not its glorious ray,
let there be light!

> 2
Thou who didst come to bring
on thy redeeming wing
healing and sight,
health to the sick in mind,
sight to the in-ly blind,
now to all humankind,
let there be light!

> 3
Spirit of truth and love,
life-giving holy Dove,
speed forth thy flight!
Move on the waters' face
bearing the gifts of grace,
and, in earth's darkest place,
let there be light!

> 4
Holy and bless√®d Three,
glorious Trinity,
wisdom, love, might;
boundless as ocean's tide,
rolling in fullest pride,
through the world far and wide,
let there be light!
