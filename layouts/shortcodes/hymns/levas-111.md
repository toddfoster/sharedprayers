_Come, Thou font_ (LEVAS 111)

> 1
Come, Thou fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing thy grace;
Streams of mercy never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount, O fix me on it.
Mount of God’s unchanging love.

> 2
Here I raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by thy help I’m come;
And I hope, by thy good pleasure,
Surely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand’ring from the fold of God.
He, to save my soul from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

> 3
O, to grace how great a debtor,
Daily I’m constrained to be;
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love.
Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it from thy courts above.
