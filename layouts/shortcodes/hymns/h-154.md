##### [Hear this hymn played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3a8fTTrAdE)

> Refrain:
All glory, laud, and honor
to thee, Redeemer, King!
to whom the lips of children
made sweet hosannas ring.

> 1
Thou art the King of Israel,
thou David's royal Son,
who in the Lord's Name comest,
the King and Blessed One. (Refrain)

> 2
The company of angels
are praising thee on high;
and we with all creation
in chorus make reply. (Refrain)

> 3
The people of the Hebrews
with palms before thee went;
our praise and prayer and anthems
before thee we present. (Refrain)

> 4
To thee before thy passion
they sang their hymns of praise;
to thee, now high exalted,
our melody we raise. (Refrain)

> 5
Thou didst accept their praises;
accept the prayers we bring,
who in all good delightest,
thou good and gracious King. (Refrain)
