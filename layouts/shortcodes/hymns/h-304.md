_I come with joy_ (Hymnal 304)

> 1
I come with joy to meet my Lord,
forgiven, loved, and free,
in awe and wonder to recall,
his life laid down for me.

> 2
I come with Christians far and near
to find, as all are fed,
the new community of love
in Christ's communion bread.

> 3
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,
each proud division ends.
The love that made us, makes us one,
and strangers now are friends.

> 4
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
His presence, always near,
is in such friendship better known,
we see and praise him here.

> 5
Together met, together bound,
we'll go our different ways
and as his people in the world,
we'll live and speak his praise.
