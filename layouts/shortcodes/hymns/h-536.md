_Open your ears, O faithful people_ (Hymnal 536)

> 1
Open your ears, O faithful people,
open your ears and hear God's word.
Open your hearts, O royal priesthood,
God has come to you.

> _Refrain_
God has spoken to God's people, Hallelujah!
And his words are words of wisdom, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
God has spoken to God's people, Hallelujah!
And his words are words of wisdom, Hallelujah!

> 2
The who have ears to hear the message,
they who have ears, then let them hear.
They who would learn the way of wisdom,
let them hear God's word.

> _Refrain_

> 3
Israel comes to greet the Savior
Judah is glad to see his day.
From east and west the peoples travel,
he will show the way.
