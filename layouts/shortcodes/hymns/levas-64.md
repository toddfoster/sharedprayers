_I Love to Tell the Story_ (LEVAS 64)

> 1
I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story,
Because I know it’s true;
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else would do.

> Refrain:
I love to tell the story;
Twill be my theme in glory.
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.

> 2
I love to tell the story,
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it, like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
’Twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long. (refrain)
