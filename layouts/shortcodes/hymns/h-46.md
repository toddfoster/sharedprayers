_To you before the close of day_ (Hymnal 46)

> 1
The duteous day now closeth,
each flower and tree reposeth,
shade creeps o'er wild and wood:
let us, as night is falling,
on God our Maker calling,
give thanks to him, the Giver good.

> 2
Now all the heavenly splendor
breaks forth in starlight tender
from myriad worlds unknown;
and we, this marvel seeing,
forget our selfish being
for joy of beauty not our own.

> 3
Though long our mortal blindness
has missed God's loving kindness
and plunged us into strife;
yet when life's day is over,
shall death's fair night discover
the fields of everlasting life.
