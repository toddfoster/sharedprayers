_Love Lifted Me_ (LEVAS 198)

> 1 I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me
Now safe am I.

> Refrain:
Love lifted even me,
Love lifted even me,
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.

> 2 
All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs. [Refrain]

> 3 
Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves.
He’s the master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your savior wants to be,
Be saved today. [Refrain]
