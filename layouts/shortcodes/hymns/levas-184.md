_Blessed Assurance_ (LEVAS 184)

> 1
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His spirit, washed in His blood.

> Refrain:
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my savior all the day long.

> 2 
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. [Refrain]

> 3 
Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love. [Refrain]
