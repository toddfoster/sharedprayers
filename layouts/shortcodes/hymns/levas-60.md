_How Great Thou Art_ (LEVAS 60)

> 1
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made,
I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy powâ€™r throughout the universe displayed.

> Refrain:
Then sings my soul, my Savior, God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

> 2
When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.
[Refrain]

> 3
And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,
Send him to die, I scarce can take it in,
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.
[Refrain]

> 4
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God how great thou art.
[Refrain]
