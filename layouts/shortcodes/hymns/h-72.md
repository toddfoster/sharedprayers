_Hark, the glad sound!_ (Hymnal 72)

> 1
Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,
the Savior promised long:
let every heart prepare a throne,
and every voice a song.

> 2
He comes, the prisoners to release
in Satan's bondage held;
the gates of brass before him burst,
the iron fetters yield.

> 3
He comes, the broken heart to bind,
the bleeding soul to cure;
and with the treasures of his grace
to enrich the humble poor.

> 4
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
thy welcome shall proclaim;
and heaven's eternal arches ring
with thy beloved Name.
