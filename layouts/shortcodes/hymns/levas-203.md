_There is a Balm in Gilead_ (LEVAS 203)

> Refrain:
There is a balm in Gilead
to make the wounded whole;
There is a balm in Gilead
to heal the sin-sick soul.

> 1 
Sometimes I feel discouraged,
And think my work’s in vain,
But then the holy spirit
Revives my soul again. [Refrain]

> 2 
If you cannot preach like Peter,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
And say He died for all. [Refrain]

> 3 
Don’t ever be discouraged
For Jesus is your friend,
And if you lack for knowledge,
He’ll ne’er refuse to lend. [Refrain]
