_Surely it is God_ (Hymnal 679)

> 1
Surely it is God who saves me;
trusting him, I shall not fear.
For the Lord defends and shields me
and his saving help is near.
So rejoice as you draw water
from salvation's living spring;
in the day of your deliverance thank the Lord,
his mercies sing.

> 2
Make his deeds known to the peoples;
tell out his exalted Name.
Praise the Lord, who has done great things;
all his works his might proclaim.
Zion, lift your voice in singing;
for with you has come to dwell,
in your very midst, the great and Holy
One of Israel.
