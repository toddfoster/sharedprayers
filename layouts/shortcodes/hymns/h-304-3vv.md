_I come with joy_ (Hymnal 304)

> 1
I come with joy to meet my Lord,
forgiven, loved, and free,
in awe and wonder to recall,
his life laid down for me.

> 2
I come with Christians far and near
to find, as all are fed,
the new community of love
in Christ's communion bread.

> 3
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,
each proud division ends.
The love that made us, makes us one,
and strangers now are friends.
