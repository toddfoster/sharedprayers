_Nearer, My God, to Thee_ (LEVAS 54)

> 1
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me;
Still all my song would be

> Refrain:
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

> 2
Though like the wanderer,
The sun goes down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be [Refrain]

> 3
There let the way appear,
Steps unto heav’n;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy giv’n;
Angels to beckon me [Refrain]

> 4
Then, with my waking thoughts,
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs,
Bethel I’ll raise;
So by my woes to be [Refrain]

> 5
Or if on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be [Refrain]
