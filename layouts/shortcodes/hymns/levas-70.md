_I Want Jesus to Walk with Me_ (LEVAS 70)

> 1
I want Jesus to walk with me;
I want Jesus to walk with me;
All along my pilgrim journey, Lord,
I want Jesus to walk with me.

> 2
In my trials, Lord, walk with me;
In my trials, Lord, walk with me;
When the shades of life are falling, Lord,
I want Jesus to walk with me.

> 3
In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me;
In my sorrows, Lord, walk with me;
When my heart within is aching, Lord,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
