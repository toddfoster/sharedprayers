_In Christ There Is No East or West_ (Hymnal 529)

> 1
In Christ there is no East or West,
in him no South or North,
but one great fellowship of love
throughout the whole wide earth.

> 2
Join hands, disciples of the faith,
whate'er your race may be!
Who serves my Father as his child
is surely kin to me.

> 3
In Christ now meet both East and West,
in him meet South and North,
all Christly souls are one in him,
throughout the whole wide earth.
