_Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove_ (Hymnal 510)

> 1
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
with all thy quickening powers;
kindle a flame of sacred love
in these cold hearts of ours.

> 2
See how we trifle here below,
fond of these earthly toys:
our souls, how heavily they go,
to reach eternal joys.

> 3
In vain we tune our formal songs,
in vain we strive to rise:
hosannas languish on our tongues,
and our devotion dies.

> 4
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
with all thy quickening powers;
come, shed abroad a Savior's love,
and that shall kindle ours.
