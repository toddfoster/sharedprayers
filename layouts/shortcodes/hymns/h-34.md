_Christ, Mighty Savior, Light of all creation_ (Hymnal 34)

> 1
Christ, mighty Savior, Light of all creation,
you make the day time radiant with the sunlight
and to the night give glittering adornment,
stars in the heavens..

> 2
Now comes the day's end as the sun is setting:
mirror of daybreak, pledge of resurrection;
while in the heavens choirs of stars appearing
hallow the nightfall.

> 3
Therefore we come now evening rites to offer,
joyfully chanting holy hymns to praise you,
with all creation joining hearts and voices
singing your glory.

> 4
Give heed, we pray you, to our supplication:
that you may grant us pardon for offenses,
strength for our weak hearts, worshiping our Savior
now and forever.

> 5
Though bodies slumber, hearts shall keep their vigil,
for ever resting in the peace of Jesus,
in light or darkness worshiping our Savior
now and forever.
