_Christ has arisen, Alleluia_ (LEVAS 41)

> Christ has arisen, Alleluia.
Rejoice and praise him, Alleluia.
For our Redeemer burst from the tomb,
Even from death dispelling its gloom.
Let us sing praise to Him with endless joy.
Death's fearful sting He has come to destroy,
Our sin for giving, Alleluia.
Jesus is living, Alleluia.
