_Lead Me to Calvary_ (LEVAS 31)

> 1
King of my life I crown thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget thy thorn-crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

 >Refrain:
Lest I forget Gethsemane,
Lest I forget thine agony,
Lest I forget thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

> 2
Show me the tomb where thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded thee whilst Thou slept. [Refrain]

> 3
Let me, like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary. [Refrain]

> 4
May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for thee;
Even thy cup of grief to share
Thou hast borne all for me. [Refrain]
