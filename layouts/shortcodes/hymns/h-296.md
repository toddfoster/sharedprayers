_We know that Christ is raised_ (Hymnal 296)

> 1
We know that Christ is raised and dies no more.
Embraced by death he broke its fearful hold;
and our despair he turned to blazing joy.
Alleluia!

> 2
We share by water in his saving death.
Reborn we share with him an Easter life
as living members of a living Christ.
Alleluia!

> 3
The Father's splendor clothes the Son with life.
The Spirit's power shakes the Church of God.
Baptized we live with God the Three in One.
Alleluia!

> 4
A new creation comes to life and grows
as Christ's new body takes on flesh and blood.
The universe restored and whole will sing:
Alleluia! Amen.
