_O for a thousand tongues_ (Hymnal 493)

> 1
O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!

> 2
My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
and spread through all the earth abroad
the honors of thy Name.

> 3
Jesus! the Name that charms our fears
and bids our sorrows cease;
'tis music in the sinner's ears,
'tis life and health and peace.

> 4
He speaks; and, listening to his voice,
new life the dead receive,
the mournful broken hearts rejoice,
the humble poor believe.

> 5
Hear him, ye deaf; ye voiceless ones,
your loosened tongues employ;
ye blind, behold your Savior comes;
and leap, ye lame, for joy!

> 6
Glory to God and praise and love
be now and ever given
by saints below and saints above,
the church in earth and heaven.
