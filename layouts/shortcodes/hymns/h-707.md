_Take my life, and let it be_ (Hymnal 707)

> 1
Take my life, and let it be
consecrated, Lord, to thee;
take my moments and my days,
let them flow in ceaseless praise.
Take my hands, and let them move
at the impulse of thy love;
take my heart, it is thine own;
it shall be thy royal throne.

> 2
Take my voice, and let me sing
always, only, for my King;
Take my intellect, and use
every power as thou shalt choose.
Take my will and make it thine;
it shall be no longer mine.
Take myself, and I will be
ever, only, all for thee.
