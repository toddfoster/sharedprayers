_One Bread, One Body_ (LEVAS 151)

> Chorus:
One bread, one body,
one Lord of all,
one cup of blessing which we bless.
And we, though many,
throughout the earth,
we are on body in this one Lord.

> 1
Gentile or Jew,
servant or free,
woman or man,
no more.

> 2
Many the gifts,
many the works,
one in the Lord
of all.

> 3
Grain for the fields,
scattered and grown,
gathered to one
for all.
