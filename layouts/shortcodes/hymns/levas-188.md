_It Is Well with My Soul_ (LEVAS 188)

> 1
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like seabillows roll;
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

> Refrain:
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

> 2 
Though satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And has shed His own blood for my soul. [Refrain]

> 3 
My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! [Refrain]

> 4 
And, Lord, hast the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,
“Even so” it is well with my soul. [Refrain]
