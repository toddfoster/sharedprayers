_Rise up, ye saints of God!_ (Hymnal 551)

> 1
Rise up, ye saints of God!
Have done with lesser things,
give heart and soul and mind and strength
to serve the King of kings.

> 2 
Rise up, ye saints of God!
His kingdom tarries long:
Lord, bring the day of truth and love
and end the night of wrong.

> 3 
Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where his feet have trod;
and quickened by the Spirit's power,
rise up, ye saints of God!
