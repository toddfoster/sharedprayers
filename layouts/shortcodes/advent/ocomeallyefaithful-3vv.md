_O Come, All Ye Faithful_

> 1
O come, all ye faithful,
joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem;
come, and behold him,
born the King of angels;

> Refrain:
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.

> 2
God from God,
Light from Light eternal,
lo! he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
only-begotten Son of the Father;
[Refrain]

> 3
Sing, choirs of angels,
sing in exultation;
sing, all ye citizens of heaven above;
glory to God, glory in the highest;
[Refrain]
