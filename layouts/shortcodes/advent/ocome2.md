![Veni, veni, Emmanuel](/images/music/ocome-compact.png)

> **O come, O come, thou Lord of might, who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
in ancient times didst give the law, in cloud and majesty and awe.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.**

> **O come, thou Branch of Jesse's tree, free them from Satan's tyranny
that trust thy mighty power save, and give them victory o'er the grave.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.**
