##### The priest will light a candle of remembrance and place it in the basin on the altar. If you so desire, you may take a candle from the basket, light it from the candles in the Advent Wreath, and place it in the basin to represent a memory, concern or burden of heart that you wish to place on the altar for Godâ€™s tender ministrations.
