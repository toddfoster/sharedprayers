_Hark! the hearld angels sing_ (Hymnal 87)

> 1
Hark! the herald angels sing
glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
with the angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem!

> Refrain:
Hark! the herald angels sing,
glory to the newborn King!

> 2
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold him come,
offspring of the virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
hail the incarnate Deity.
Pleased as man with us to dwell;
Jesus, our Immanuel! (Refrain)

> 3
Mild he lays his glory by,
born that we no more may die,
born to raise us from the earth,
born to give us second birth.
Risen with healing in his wings,
Light and life to all he brings,
hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace! (Refrain)
