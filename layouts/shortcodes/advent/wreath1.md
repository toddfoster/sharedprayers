### Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath

Today we light the first candle of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE.

> We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:20)

Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. **Amen.**
