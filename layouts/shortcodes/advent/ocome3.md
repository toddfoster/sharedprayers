![Veni, veni, Emmanuel](/images/music/ocome-compact.png)

> **O come, thou Key of David, come, and open wide our heavenly home;
make safe the way that leads on high, and close the path to misery.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.**

> **O come, Thou Day-spring from on high and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;
disperse the gloomy clouds of night, and death's dark shadow put to flight.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.**
