### A Litany of Remembering

Presider:
> We light this first Advent candle to remember those persons who have been loved and lost. We pause to remember their names, their faces, their voices. We give thanks for the memory that binds them to us this during season which anticipates Christmas.

**People:**
> **May Godâ€™s eternal love surround them.**

Presider:
> We light the second candle to redeem the pain of loss: the loss of relationships, the loss of jobs, the loss of health. As we gather up the pain of the past, we offer it to you, O God, asking that into our open hands you will place the gift of peace.

**People:**
> **Refresh, restore, renew us, O God, and lead us into your future.**

Presider:
> We light this third candle to remember ourselves this Christmas time. We pause and remember the past weeks, months and for some of us, years of difficult times. We remember the poignancy of memories, the grief, the sadness, the hurts, the pain of reflecting on our own mortality.

**People:**
> **Let us remember that dawn defeats darkness.**

Presider:
> This fourth candle is lit to remember our faith and the gift of hope which God offers to us in the Christmas story. We remember that God, who shares our life, promises us a place and time of no more pain and suffering.

**People:**
> **Let us remember the one who shows the way and who goes with us into our tomorrows.**

##### The Christ candle will remain unlit as a sign of waiting for a future that is yet unknown to us, toward which God beckons us.
