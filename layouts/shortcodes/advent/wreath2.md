### Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath

Today we light the first and second candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE.

> Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. (Colossians 3:15)

Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. **Amen.**
