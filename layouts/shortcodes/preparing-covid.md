## Preparing for the Liturgy

During this season of coronavirus infections, please demonstrate your love for your friends and neighbors by:

1. Wearing a mask (covering both mouth and nose)
2. Remaining six feet apart from anyone you donâ€™t live with
3. Refraining from touching, hugging and shaking hands -- even during the Peace
4. Singing is only permitted outdoors, six feet apart, wearing masks
5. Service bulletins you have touched must be taken home
6. After the service everyone must disperse with no lingering
7. No sharing of common objects such as pens, paper, water bottles, etc.

If you are feeling ill or think you may have been exposed to someone ill within the last two weeks, _please stay home_ and participate with us online instead of in person.
