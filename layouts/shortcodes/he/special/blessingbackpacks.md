### Blessing of the Backpacks
##### Presider:
We are here today to proclaim our support and our blessing on these our students, faculty, and staff of our church school, public and private schools, homeschools, trade schools, and colleges and universities. Learning and growth are central ideas in the Kingdom of God: they are the invitation of God so that we might grow into fullness of Godâ€™s intention and, always connected to the vine who is Jesus, bear much good fruit for the blessing of the whole world. Let us pray.

O Eternal God, bless all schools, colleges and universities, that they may be lively centers for sound learning, new discovery, and the pursuit of wisdom; grant that those who teach and those who learn may find you to be the source of all truth.

Now sanctify this water, we pray you, by the power of your Holy Spirit, as a reminder of our baptism; and as this water is sprinkled on these students and teachers, and on their backpacks and other instruments of learning and service, may they be strengthened in memory, reason, and skill. Grant that these pocket crosses [or other tags or tokens], carried in their backpacks, may remind them of your love and presence throughout the day as they learn.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**

##### Asperges may be performed over the students, faculty, and staff, and over the tokens they have brought to the altar.
##### After the asperges, the congregation is invited to stand and offer its blessing:
##### Student:
God, you were present at the beginning. Be with us as we begin a new school year. Comfort us when we are unsure of our new surroundings. Strengthen us when we stumble, and help us to remember that your light shines in all places. All this we ask through you, our Creator, Redeemer, and Sustainer.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**

**Jesus, who calls us each by name to follow him, give you the courage and confidence to be his disciples wherever you may be, at school, at work, and at home. May the gifts God has given you be a source of blessing for you and for others. Amen.**
