O heavenly Father, whose blessed Son taught the disciples in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.  Bless these Bibles which we present to our children today, and grant that we and our children may so diligently search your holy word that we may find in it the wisdom that leads to salvation; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
