### The Nicene Creed
##### The people stand as able.
##### Officiant and **People:**
We believe in one God,
	**the Father, the Almighty,
	maker of heaven and earth,
	of all that is, seen and unseen.**
    
**We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
	the only Son of God,
	eternally begotten of the Father,
	God from God, Light from Light,
	true God from true God,
	begotten, not made,
	of one Being with the Father;
	through him all things were made.
	For us and for our salvation
		he came down from heaven,
		was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary
		and became truly human.
		For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
            he suffered death and was buried.
		On the third day he rose again
		in accordance with the Scriptures;
		he ascended into heaven
		and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
		He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
		and his kingdom will have no end.**
        
**We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
	who proceeds from the Father,
	who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,
	who has spoken through the prophets.
	We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
	We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
	We look for the resurrection of the dead,
		and the life of the world to come. Amen.**
