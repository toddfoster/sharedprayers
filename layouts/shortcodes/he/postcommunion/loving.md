### The Post-communion Prayer
##### Presider:
Let us pray.

##### **People:**
**Loving God, we give you thanks
for restoring us in your image
and nourishing us with spiritual food
in the Sacrament of Christâ€™s Body and Blood.
Now send us forth a people, forgiven, healed, renewed;
that we may proclaim your love to the world
and continue in the risen life of Christ our Savior. Amen.**
