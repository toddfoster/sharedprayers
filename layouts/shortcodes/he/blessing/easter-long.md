> May Almighty God, who has redeemed us and made us his children through the resurrection of his Son our Lord, bestow upon you the riches of his blessing. **Amen.**

> May God, who through the water of baptism has raised us from sin into newness of life, make you holy and worthy to be united with Christ for ever. **Amen.**

> May God, who has brought us out of bondage to sin into true and lasting freedom in the Redeemer, bring you to your eternal inheritance. **Amen.**

> And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, be upon you and remain with you for ever. **Amen.**
