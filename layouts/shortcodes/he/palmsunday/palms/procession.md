_All glory, laud, and honor_ (Hymnal 154)
##### [Hear this hymn played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3a8fTTrAdE)

> Refrain:
All glory, laud, and honor
to thee, Redeemer, King!
to whom the lips of children
made sweet hosannas ring.

> 1
Thou art the King of Israel,
thou David's royal Son,
who in the Lord's Name comest,
the King and Blessed One. (Refrain)

> 2
The company of angels
are praising thee on high;
and we with all creation
in chorus make reply. (Refrain)

> 3
The people of the Hebrews
with palms before thee went;
our praise and prayer and anthems
before thee we present. (Refrain)

> 4
To thee before thy passion
they sang their hymns of praise;
to thee, now high exalted,
our melody we raise. (Refrain)

> 5
Thou didst accept their praises;
accept the prayers we bring,
who in all good delightest,
thou good and gracious King. (Refrain)

##### At a suitable place, the procession may halt while the following or some other appropriate Collect is said

##### **People:**
> **Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.**

##### As the procession proceeds, we say aloud:
**Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29** --- _Confitemini Domino_
> 1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *
> his mercy endures for ever.
>
>2 Let Israel now proclaim, *
> "His mercy endures for ever."
>
> 19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *
> I will enter them; I will offer thanks to the Lord.
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**
>
> 20 "This is the gate of the Lord; *
> he who is righteous may enter."
>
> 21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *
> and have become my salvation.
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**
>
> 22 The same stone which the builders rejected *
> has become the chief cornerstone.
>
> 23 This is the Lord's doing, *
> and it is marvelous in our eyes.
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**
>
> 24 On this day the Lord has acted; *

>
> 25 Hosannah, Lord, hosannah! *
