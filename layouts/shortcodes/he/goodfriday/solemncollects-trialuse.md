### The Solemn Collects

Deacon:

That unity and concord may exist between Jews and Christians, in obedience to God’s will.

##### Silence


Priest:
> O God of Abraham, you planted your people Israel as the root and grafted Gentiles as wild branches into a single olive tree of praise to you: As we come near to the cross, we lament Christian acts of prejudice and violence against your faithful people, of whom Jesus Christ was born. Bless the children of your covenant, so that together we may attain the fullness of your blessing for the world. 

**People:**
> **Amen.**


Deacon:
> Let us pray for all who suffer and are afflicted in body or in mind; For those who are hungry and homeless, destitute and oppressed; For those who are ill or disabled, in body, mind, or spirit; For those in loneliness, fear, and anguish; For those who face temptation, doubt, and despair; For those who are sorrowful and bereaved; For those who are persecuted for the sake of Christ; For prisoners, refugees, and captives; For victims of war, genocide, and trafficking, and all those in mortal danger: that God in God’s mercy will comfort and relieve them, and grant them the knowledge of his love, and stir up in us the will and patience to minister to their needs.

##### Silence


Priest:
> Gracious God, the comfort of all who sorrow, the strength of all who suffer: Let the cry of those in misery and need come to you, that they may find your mercy present with them in all their afflictions; and give us, we pray, the strength to serve them for the sake of him who suffered for us, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

**People:**
> **Amen.**

Deacon:
> Let us pray for those who have not embraced God’s redemptive love; For those who have never heard the word of salvation; For those who have lost their faith; For those hardened by sin or indifference; For the contemptuous and the scornful; For those who are enemies of the cross of Christ and persecutors of his disciples; For those who in the name of Christ have persecuted others; That God will open their hearts to the truth, and lead them to faith and obedience.

##### Silence

Priest:
> Merciful God, the source of life and fountain of mercy, let the Gospel of your Son Jesus Christ be preached with grace and love; turn the hearts of the followers of Jesus who have harmed others in his name; lead all to repentance and amendment of life; and sustain by your loving grace all who lift their eyes to you. 

**People:**
> **Amen.**

Deacon:
> Let us commit ourselves to our God, and pray for the grace of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown of life in the day of resurrection.

##### Silence

Priest:
> O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down are being raised up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

**People:**
> **Amen.**
