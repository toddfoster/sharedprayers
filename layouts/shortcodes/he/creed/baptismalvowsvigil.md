### The Renewal of Baptismal Vows
##### Presider:
Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to newness of life. I call upon you, therefore, now that our Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully in his holy Catholic Church.

##### Presider:
Do you reaffirm your renunciation of evil and renew your commitment to Jesus Christ?

##### **People:**
**I do.**

##### Presider:
Do you believe in God the Father?

##### **People:**
**I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.**

##### Presider:
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God?

##### **People:**
**I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
and born of the Virgin Mary.
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended to the dead.
On the third day he rose again.
He ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.**


##### Presider:
Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?

##### **People:**
**I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.**

##### Presider:
Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?

##### **People:**
**I will, with God’s help.**

##### Presider:
Will you persevere in resisting evil, and, whenever you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord?

##### **People:**
**I will, with God’s help.**

##### Presider:
Will you proclaim by word and example the Good News of God in Christ?

##### **People:**
**I will, with God’s help.**

##### Presider:
Will you seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving your neighbor as yourself?

##### **People:**
**I will, with God’s help.**

##### Presider:
Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?

##### **People:**
**I will, with God’s help.**

##### Presider:
May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, and bestowed upon us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal life by his grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord. **Amen.**
