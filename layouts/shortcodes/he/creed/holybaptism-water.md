### Thanksgiving over the Water
##### The Celebrant blesses the water, first saying

##### Celebrant:
The Lord be with you.
##### **People:**
And also with you.

##### Celebrant:
 Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
##### **People:**
 It is right to give him thanks and praise.

##### Celebrant:
We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.

We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Now sanctify this water, we pray you, by the power of your
Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus
Christ our Savior.

To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and
glory, now and for ever.

##### **People:**
**Amen.**

## The Baptism
##### Each candidate is presented by name to the Celebrant, or to an assisting priest or deacon, who then immerses, or pours water upon, the candidate, saying:
N., I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

##### Then the Bishop or Priest places a hand on the person’s head, marking on the forehead the sign of the cross [using Chrism if desired] and saying to each one
N., you are sealed by the Holy Spirit in Baptism and marked as Christ’s own for ever. Amen.

##### When this action has been completed for all candidates, the Bishop or Priest, at a place in full sight of the congregation, prays over them, saying:
Let us pray.

Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy
Spirit you have bestowed upon these your servants the
forgiveness of sin, and have raised them to the new life of
grace. Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit. Give them
an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to
persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy
and wonder in all your works. Amen.

##### When all have been baptized, the Celebrant says:
Let us welcome the newly baptized.

##### **Celebrant and People:**
**We receive you into the household of God. Confess the faith of Christ crucified, proclaim his resurrection, and share with us in his eternal priesthood.**
