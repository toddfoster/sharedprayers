### Confession of Sin
##### Officiant:
Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.

##### The people kneel or stand as able. Silence may be kept.

##### Officiant and **People:**
**Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name. Amen.**

##### Priest:
Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you  in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life.

##### People:
**Amen.**
