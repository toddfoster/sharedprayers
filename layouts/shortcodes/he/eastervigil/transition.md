##### Presider:
Alleluia! Christ is risen!

##### **People:**
**The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia!**


##### Presider:
Alleluia! Christ is risen!

##### **People:**
**The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia!**


##### Presider:
Alleluia! Christ is risen!

##### **People:**
**The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia!**

##### If inside, the lights are turned on and the people’s candles are extinguished.
##### Make noise! Ring bells! Shout “Alleluia!” Stomp your feet. Rejoice!
