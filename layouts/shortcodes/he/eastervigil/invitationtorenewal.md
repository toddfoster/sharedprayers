Presider:
> Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried
with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to
newness of life. I call upon you, therefore, now that our
Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises
and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced
Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully
in his holy Catholic Church.
