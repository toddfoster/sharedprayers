# The Lighting of the Paschal Candle

##### In the darkness, fire is kindled; after which the Celebrant may address the people in these or similar words
Presider:
> Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share
in his victory over death.

> Let us pray.

> O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

##### The Paschal Candle is then lighted from the newly kindled fire, and the Deacon (the Celebrant if there is no deacon) bearing the Candle, leads the procession to the chancel, pausing three times and singing or saying

Deacon:
> The light of Christ.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

### The Exsultet
> Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,
and let your trumpets shout Salvation
for the victory of our mighty King.

> Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth,
bright with a glorious splendor,
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.

> Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church,
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,
resound with the praises of your people.

> All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame,
pray with me to God the Almighty
for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light;
through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord,
who lives and reigns with him,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**

> The Lord be with you.

**People:**
> **And also with you.**

> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**People:**
> **It is right to give God thanks and praise.**

> It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our
whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.

> This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the
Red Sea on dry land.

> This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness
of life.

> This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,
and rose victorious from the grave.

> How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your
mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you
gave a Son.

> How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings
peace and concord.

> How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined
and man is reconciled to God.

> Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. **Amen.**

##### It is customary that the Paschal Candle burn at all services from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost.
