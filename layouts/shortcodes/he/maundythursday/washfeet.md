### The Washing of Feet
##### Everyone is encouraged to participate in the washing of feet. This is a time to step past our embarrassment and squeamishness and to step bodily into the experience of Holy Week. There is an additional chair in case you would like to wash someone’s feet as well. However, in modern times, it is as much a spiritual act of service to allow your feet to be washed by another as it is to wash another’s feet.

**Anthem**
The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and
had washed their feet, said to them, “Do you know what I,
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you
an example, that you should do as I have done.”

_Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you._

I give you a new commandment: Love one another as I have
loved you.

_Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you._

By this shall the world know that you are my disciples: That
you have love for one another.
