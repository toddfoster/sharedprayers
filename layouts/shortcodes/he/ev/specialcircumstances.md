## Communion under Special Circumstances
### The Lord's Prayer
##### Celebrant:
Let us pray in the words our Savior Christ has taught us.

##### Celebrant and **People:**
Our Father, **who art in heaven,
	hallowed be thy Name,
	thy kingdom come,
	thy will be done,
	on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
	as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
	but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
	for ever and ever.  Amen.**

##### Celebrant:
The Gifts of God for the People of God.

##### The Sacrament is administered with the following or other words:
The Body (Blood) of our Lord Jesus Christ keep you in everlasting life. [**Amen.**]

##### One of the usual postcommunion prayers is then said, or the following
**Gracious Father, we give you praise and thanks for this Holy
Communion of the Body and Blood of your beloved Son
Jesus Christ, the pledge of our redemption; and we pray that
it may bring us forgiveness of our sins, strength in our
weakness, and everlasting salvation; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.**
