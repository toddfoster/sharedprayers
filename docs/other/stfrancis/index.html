<blockquote>
<p>3	Who never do any wrong, *<br>
but always walk in his ways.<br>
<strong>4	You laid down your commandments, *<br>
that we should fully keep them.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

all the judgments of your mouth.<br>

instruct me in your statutes.</strong></p></blockquote>

strengthen me according to your word.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

I shall keep it for ever and ever.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>45	I will walk at liberty, *<br>
because I study your commandments.<br>

and will not be ashamed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

which I have always loved.<br>

that your promise gives me life.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>51	The proud have derided me cruelly, *<br>
but I have not turned from your law.<br>
<strong>52	When I remember your judgments of old, *<br>
O LORD, I take great comfort.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>53	I am filled with a burning rage, *<br>
because of the wicked who forsake your law.<br>
<strong>54	Your statutes have been like songs to me *<br>
wherever I have lived as a stranger.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>55	I remember your Name in the night, O LORD, *<br>
and dwell upon your law.<br>
<strong>56	This is how it has been with me, *<br>
because I have kept your commandments.</strong></p></blockquote>

<em>Portio mea, Domine</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>57	You only are my portion, O LORD; *<br>
I have promised to keep your words.<br>
<strong>58	I entreat you with all my heart, *<br>
be merciful to me according to your promise.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>59	I have considered my ways *<br>
and turned my feet toward your decrees.<br>

to keep your commandments.</strong></p></blockquote>

I do not forget your law.<br>

because of your righteous judgments.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>63	I am a companion of all who fear you *<br>
and of those who keep your commandments.<br>

instruct me in your statutes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Teth</strong><br>
<em>Bonitatem fecisti</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>65	O LORD, you have dealt graciously with your servant, *<br>
according to your word.<br>
<strong>66	Teach me discernment and knowledge, *<br>
for I have believed in your commandments.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>67	Before I was afflicted I went astray, *<br>
but now I keep your word.<br>
<strong>68	You are good and you bring forth good; *<br>
instruct me in your statutes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>69	The proud have smeared me with lies, *<br>
but I will keep your commandments with my whole heart.<br>
<strong>70	Their heart is gross and fat, *<br>
but my delight is in your law.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>71	It is good for me that I have been afflicted, *<br>
that I might learn your statutes.<br>
<strong>72	The law of your mouth is dearer to me *<br>
than thousands in gold and silver.</strong></p></blockquote>

give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.<br>

as you have promised to your servant.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>77	Let your compassion come to me, that I may live, *<br>
for your law is my delight.<br>

but I will meditate on your commandments.</strong></p></blockquote>

and also those who know your decrees.<br>

that I may not be put to shame.</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>81	My soul has longed for your salvation; *<br>
I have put my hope in your word.<br>
<strong>82	My eyes have failed from watching for your promise, *<br>
and I say, &ldquo;When will you comfort me?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>83	I have become like a leather flask in the smoke, *<br>
but I have not forgotten your statutes.<br>
<strong>84	How much longer must I wait? *<br>
when will you give judgment against those who persecute me?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>85	The proud have dug pits for me; *<br>
they do not keep your law.<br>
<strong>86	All your commandments are true; *<br>
help me, for they persecute me with lies.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>87	They had almost made an end of me on earth, *<br>
but I have not forsaken your commandments.<br>

that I may keep the decrees of your mouth.</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>91	By your decree these continue to this day, *<br>
for all things are your servants.<br>

that I may keep your word.<br>

because you yourself have taught me.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>103	How sweet are your words to my taste! *<br>
they are sweeter than honey to my mouth.<br>

therefore I hate every lying way.</strong></p></blockquote>

and a light upon my path.<br>

to keep your righteous judgments.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>107	I am deeply troubled; *<br>
preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.<br>

and teach me your judgments.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>109	My life is always in my hand, *<br>
yet I do not forget your law.<br>
<strong>110	The wicked have set a trap for me, *<br>
but I have not strayed from your commandments.</strong></p></blockquote>

I will keep the commandments of my God.<br>

and let me not be disappointed in my hope.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>117	Hold me up, and I shall be safe, *<br>
and my delight shall be ever in your statutes.<br>
<strong>118	You spurn all who stray from your statutes; *<br>
their deceitfulness is in vain.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>119	In your sight all the wicked of the earth are but dross; *<br>
therefore I love your decrees.<br>

I am afraid of your judgments.</strong></p></blockquote>

for they have broken your law.</strong></p></blockquote>

more than gold and precious stones.<br>

all paths of falsehood I abhor.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.’ And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.’</p>
<p>So God created humankind in his image,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the image of God he created them;<br>
male and female he created them.</p></blockquote>
<p>God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.’ God said, ‘See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.’ And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>
