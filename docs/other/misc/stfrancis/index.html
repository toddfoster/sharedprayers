<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.’ And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.’</p>
<p>So God created humankind in his image,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the image of God he created them;<br>
male and female he created them.</p></blockquote>
<p>God blessed them, and God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.’ God said, ‘See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.’ And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>

Most high, omnipotent, good Lord, grant your people grace to renounce gladly the vanities of this world; that, following the way of blessed Francis, we may, for love of you, delight in your whole creation with perfectness of joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.</p>
<h5 id="people-4"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>O Lord, give us humility to thank you for the creation of animals, who can show affection which sometimes puts us to shame. Enlarge our respect for these your creatures, of whom we are the guardians. And gives us a sense of responsibility towards all your creation, for Jesus Christ’s sake.</p>
<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
