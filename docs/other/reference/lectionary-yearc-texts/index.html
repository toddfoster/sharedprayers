<p>The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: &ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Ad te, Domine, levavi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;<br>
my God, I put my trust in you; *<br>
let me not be humiliated,<br>
nor let my enemies triumph over me.<br>
<strong>2	Let none who look to you be put to shame; *<br>
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Show me your ways, O LORD, *<br>

for you are the God of my salvation;<br>
in you have I trusted all the day long.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, *<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith.</p>
<p>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we abound in love for you. And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see &rsquo;the Son of Man coming in a cloud&rsquo; with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told them a parable: &ldquo;Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Take off the garment of your sorrow and affliction, O Jerusalem, and put on forever the beauty of the glory from God.<br>
Put on the robe of the righteousness that comes from God; put on your head the diadem of the glory of the Everlasting;<br>
for God will show your splendor everywhere under heaven.<br>
For God will give you evermore the name, &ldquo;Righteous Peace, Godly Glory.&rdquo;<br>
Arise, O Jerusalem, stand upon the height; look toward the east,<br>
and see your children gathered from west and east at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God has remembered them.<br>
For they went out from you on foot, led away by their enemies;<br>
but God will bring them back to you, carried in glory, as on a royal throne.<br>
For God has ordered that every high mountain and the everlasting hills be made low and the valleys filled up, to make level ground, so that Israel may walk safely in the glory of God.<br>
The woods and every fragrant tree have shaded Israel at God&rsquo;s command.<br>
For God will lead Israel with joy, in the light of his glory, with the mercy and righteousness that come from him.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
<strong>He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
<strong>He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
<strong>Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
<strong>To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
<strong>To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>

<p>I thank my God every time I remember you, constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you, because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now. I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God&rsquo;s grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless, having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The voice of one crying out in the wilderness:<br>
&lsquo;Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low,<br>
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth;<br>
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love;<br>
he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.<br>
I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.<br>
I will deal with all your oppressors at that time.<br>
And I will save the lame and gather the outcast,<br>
and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.<br>

<p>John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our ancestor&rsquo;; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the crowds asked him, &ldquo;What then should we do?&rdquo; In reply he said to them, &ldquo;Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.&rdquo; Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, &ldquo;Teacher, what should we do?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.&rdquo; Soldiers also asked him, &ldquo;And we, what should we do?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.</p>

<p>In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

you have broken as on the day of Midian.</p>
<p>For all the boots of the tramping warriors<br>
and all the garments rolled in blood<br>
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.</p>
<p>For a child has been born for us,<br>
a son given to us;<br>
authority rests upon his shoulders;<br>
and he is named</p>
<p>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,<br>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>His authority shall grow continually,<br>
and there shall be endless peace<br>
for the throne of David and his kingdom.</p>
<p>He will establish and uphold it<br>
with justice and with righteousness<br>
from this time onward and forevermore.</p>
<p>The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>

<p>In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>
<p>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]</p>

<h5 id="lector-26">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>
<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&rdquo;?</p></blockquote>
<p>Or again,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&rdquo;?</p></blockquote>
<p>And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let all God&rsquo;s angels worship him.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the angels he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>But of the Son he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.</p></blockquote>
<p>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;<br>
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;<br>
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.<br>
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian.</p>
<p>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba!

<p>When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.</p>

<p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,<br>
among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.<br>
With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back,<br>
I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;<br>
for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.<br>
Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away;<br>
say, &ldquo;He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock.&rdquo;<br>
For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.<br>
They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD,<br>
over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd;<br>
their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.<br>
Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry.<br>
I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.<br>
I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty,</p></blockquote>

He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.</p>
<p>I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe.</p>

<p>After the wise men had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, &ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee.

<p>This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&ndash; for surely you have already heard of the commission of God&rsquo;s grace that was given me for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>
<p>Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God&rsquo;s grace that was given me by the working of his power. Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.</p>

<p>In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, &ldquo;Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.&rdquo; When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>
for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &ldquo;Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.&rdquo; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.</p>

<p>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak.

<p>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.

<p>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo; And Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.&rdquo; His mother said to the servants, &ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&rdquo; Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Fill the jars with water.&rdquo; And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them, &ldquo;Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.&rdquo; So they took it. When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom and said to him, &ldquo;Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.&rdquo; Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p>

<h5 id="lector-52">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Nehemiah.</p>
<p>All the people of Israel gathered together into the square before the Water Gate. They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had given to Israel. Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding. This was on the first day of the seventh month. He read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, &ldquo;Amen, Amen,&rdquo; lifting up their hands. Then they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. So they read from the book, from the law of God, with interpretation. They gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.</p>
<p>And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, &ldquo;This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.&rdquo; For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. Then he said to them, &ldquo;Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions of them to those for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to our LORD; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="lector-54">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&ndash;Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&ndash;and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p>Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, &ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,&rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear would say, &ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,&rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, &ldquo;I have no need of you,&rdquo; nor again the head to the feet, &ldquo;I have no need of you.&rdquo; On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect; whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.</p>
<p>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? But strive for the greater gifts.</p>

<p>Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.</p>
<p>When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,<br>
to proclaim the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favor.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, &ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>
<p>Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>

But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.&rdquo; When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage. They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff.

<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: &ldquo;Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: &ldquo;Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.&rdquo; Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &ldquo;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Here am I; send me!&rdquo; [And he said, &ldquo;Go and say to this people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Keep listening, but do not comprehend;<br>
keep looking, but do not understand.&rsquo;<br>
Make the mind of this people dull, and stop their ears, and shut their eyes,<br>
so that they may not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears,<br>
and comprehend with their minds, and turn and be healed.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then I said, &ldquo;How long, O Lord?&rdquo; And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Until cities lie waste without inhabitant,<br>
and houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate;<br>
until the Lord sends everyone far away, and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.<br>
Even if a tenth part remain in it, it will be burned again,<br>
like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains standing when it is felled.&rdquo;<br>

<p>For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.</p>

<p>Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &ldquo;Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo; Simon answered, &ldquo;Master, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.&rdquo; When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break. So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!&rdquo; For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.&rdquo; When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.</p>

<p>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ&ndash;whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.

<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?&rdquo; But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.</p>
<p>Then Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;Come closer to me.&rdquo; And they came closer. He said, &ldquo;I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children&rsquo;s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide for you there&ndash;since there are five more years of famine to come&ndash;so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.</p>

<h5 id="lector-70">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Someone will ask, &ldquo;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?&rdquo; Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.</p>
<p>So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, &ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living being&rdquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.</p>
<p>What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

<p>Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness, not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside. But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside. Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, since it is by God&rsquo;s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.</p>

<p>Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo;&ndash;not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, &ldquo;This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!&rdquo; When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.</p>
<p>[On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. Just then a man from the crowd shouted, &ldquo;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son; he is my only child. Suddenly a spirit seizes him, and all at once he shrieks. It convulses him until he foams at the mouth; it mauls him and will scarcely leave him. I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You faithless and perverse generation, how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&rdquo; While he was coming, the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. And all were astounded at the greatness of God.]</p>

<p>So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,</p>

<p>‘At an acceptable time I have listened to you,<br>
and on a day of salvation I have helped you.’</p></blockquote>
<p>See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labours, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see—we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</p>

<p>After his baptism, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished. The devil said to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;One does not live by bread alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, &ldquo;To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is said, &lsquo;Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&rsquo;&rdquo; When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>

<h5 id="lector-84">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.” But the word of the LORD came to him, “This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.” He brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.</p>
<p>Then he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?” He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</p>
<p>As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.</p>
<p>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.”</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.</p>

<h5 id="lector-88">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p>
<p>Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”</p>
<p>But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&rsquo; and they ask me, &lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&rsquo;” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&rsquo;:</p>

<h5 id="lector-90">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, &ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.&rdquo; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come. So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.</p>

<p>At that very time there were some present who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. He asked them, &ldquo;Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them&ndash;do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told this parable: &ldquo;A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said to the gardener, &lsquo;See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>From now on, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>

<p>All the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to Jesus. And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, &ldquo;This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jesus told them this parable:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a man who had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, &lsquo;Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.&rsquo; So he divided his property between them. A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he said, &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired hands have bread enough and to spare, but here I am dying of hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.&rdquo;&rsquo; So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. Then the son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo; But the father said to his slaves, &lsquo;Quickly, bring out a robe&ndash;the best one&ndash;and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!&rsquo; And they began to celebrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on. He replied, &lsquo;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has got him back safe and sound.&rsquo; Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him. But he answered his father, &lsquo;Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!&rsquo; Then the father said to him, &lsquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</p>
<p>Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,<br>

Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,<br>

and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the hour for the Passover meal came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. He said to them, &ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, &ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&rdquo; Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo; And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table. For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!&rdquo; Then they began to ask one another, which one of them it could be who would do this.</p>
<p>A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But he said to them, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to them, &ldquo;When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;No, not a thing.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, &lsquo;And he was counted among the lawless&rsquo;; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. When he reached the place, he said to them, &ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, and he said to them, &ldquo;Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?&rdquo; When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked, &ldquo;Lord, should we strike with the sword?&rdquo; Then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, &ldquo;No more of this!&rdquo; And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him, &ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter was following at a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said, &ldquo;This man also was with him.&rdquo; But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;Woman, I do not know him.&rdquo; A little later someone else, on seeing him, said, &ldquo;You also are one of them.&rdquo; But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I am not!&rdquo; Then about an hour later still another kept insisting, &ldquo;Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.&rdquo; But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I do not know what you are talking about!&rdquo; At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, &ldquo;Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.&rdquo; And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, &ldquo;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&rdquo; They kept heaping many other insults on him.</p>
<p>When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council. They said, &ldquo;If you are the Messiah, tell us.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I question you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&rdquo; All of them asked, &ldquo;Are you, then, the Son of God?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;You say that I am.&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying, &ldquo;We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.&rdquo; Then Pilate asked him, &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;You say so.&rdquo; Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &ldquo;I find no basis for an accusation against this man.&rdquo; But they were insistent and said, &ldquo;He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that he was under Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign. He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate. That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.</p>
<p>Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people, and said to them, &ldquo;You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death. I will therefore have him flogged and release him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they all shouted out together, &ldquo;Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!&rdquo; (This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.) Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again; but they kept shouting, &ldquo;Crucify, crucify him!&rdquo; A third time he said to them, &ldquo;Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.&rdquo; But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted. He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.</p>
<p>As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus. A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him. But Jesus turned to them and said, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For the days are surely coming when they will say, &lsquo;Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.&rsquo; Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &lsquo;Fall on us&rsquo;; and to the hills, &lsquo;Cover us.&rsquo; For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, while the sun&rsquo;s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, &ldquo;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.&rdquo; Having said this, he breathed his last. When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, &ldquo;Certainly this man was innocent.&rdquo; And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts. But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>
<p>Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council, had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.</p>
<p>On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>

<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!</p>
<p>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.</p>

<p>Listen to me, O coastlands,<br>

The Lord called me before I was born,<br>

He made my mouth like a sharp sword,<br>
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br>
he made me a polished arrow,<br>
in his quiver he hid me away.<br>
And he said to me, ‘You are my servant,<br>
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’<br>
But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain,<br>
I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;<br>
yet surely my cause is with the Lord,<br>
and my reward with my God.’</p>
<p>And now the Lord says,<br>

<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.</p>
<p>Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rdquo; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say&ndash; &lsquo;Father, save me from this hour&rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&rdquo; The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, &ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&rdquo; He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, &ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.</p>

<p>At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>
<p>When he had gone out, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.</p>

<p>Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”</p>
<p>After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</p>
<p>“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</p>

<p>See, my servant shall prosper;<br>
he shall be exalted and lifted up,<br>
and shall be very high.<br>
Just as there were many who were astonished at him<br>
—so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance,<br>
and his form beyond that of mortals—<br>
so he shall startle many nations;<br>
kings shall shut their mouths because of him;<br>
for that which had not been told them they shall see,<br>
and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.</p>
<p>Who has believed what we have heard?<br>
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br>
For he grew up before him like a young plant,<br>
and like a root out of dry ground;<br>
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,<br>
nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.<br>
He was despised and rejected by others;<br>
a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;<br>
and as one from whom others hide their faces<br>
he was despised, and we held him of no account.</p>
<p>Surely he has borne our infirmities<br>
and carried our diseases;<br>
yet we accounted him stricken,<br>
struck down by God, and afflicted.<br>
But he was wounded for our transgressions,<br>
crushed for our iniquities;<br>
upon him was the punishment that made us whole,<br>
and by his bruises we are healed.<br>
All we like sheep have gone astray;<br>
we have all turned to our own way,<br>
and the Lord has laid on him<br>
the iniquity of us all.</p>
<p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,<br>
yet he did not open his mouth;<br>
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br>
and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,<br>
so he did not open his mouth.<br>
By a perversion of justice he was taken away.<br>
Who could have imagined his future?<br>
For he was cut off from the land of the living,<br>
stricken for the transgression of my people.<br>
They made his grave with the wicked<br>
and his tomb with the rich,<br>
although he had done no violence,<br>
and there was no deceit in his mouth.</p>
<p>Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.<br>
When you make his life an offering for sin,<br>
he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;<br>
through him the will of the Lord shall prosper.<br>
Out of his anguish he shall see light;<br>
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.<br>
The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,<br>
and he shall bear their iniquities.<br>
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,<br>
and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;<br>
because he poured out himself to death,<br>
and was numbered with the transgressors;<br>
yet he bore the sin of many,<br>
and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful.

<p>Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, &ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;I am he.&rdquo; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, &ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.&rdquo; This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, &ldquo;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&rdquo; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest&rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave&rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.</p>
<p>Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, &ldquo;You are not also one of this man&rsquo;s disciples, are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.</p>
<p>Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, &ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.&rdquo; When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&rdquo; Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
<p>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, &ldquo;You are not also one of his disciples, are you?&rdquo; He denied it and said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&rdquo; Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.</p>
<p>Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate&rsquo;s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, &ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&rdquo; The Jews replied, &ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death.&rdquo; (This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)</p>
<p>Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?&rdquo; Pilate replied, &ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&rdquo; Pilate asked him, &ldquo;So you are a king?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&rdquo; Pilate asked him, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &ldquo;I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&rdquo; They shouted in reply, &ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!&rdquo; Now Barabbas was a bandit.</p>
<p>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, &ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.&rdquo; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Here is the man!&rdquo; When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted, &ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&rdquo; The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&rdquo; From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, &ldquo;If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&rsquo;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &ldquo;Here is your King!&rdquo; They cried out, &ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&rdquo; Pilate asked them, &ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&rdquo; The chief priests answered, &ldquo;We have no king but the emperor.&rdquo; Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>
<p>So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&rdquo; Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &ldquo;Do not write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&rsquo;&rdquo; Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written I have written.&rdquo; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, &ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&rdquo; This was to fulfill what the scripture says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that is what the soldiers did.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &ldquo;Woman, here is your son.&rdquo; Then he said to the disciple, &ldquo;Here is your mother.&rdquo; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</p>
<p>After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo; A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p>Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, &ldquo;None of his bones shall be broken.&rdquo; And again another passage of scripture says, &ldquo;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble,<br>
comes up like a flower and withers,<br>
flees like a shadow and does not last.<br>
Do you fix your eyes on such a one?<br>
Do you bring me into judgement with you?<br>
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?<br>
No one can.<br>
Since their days are determined,<br>
and the number of their months is known to you,<br>
and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,<br>
look away from them, and desist,<br>
that they may enjoy, like labourers, their days.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘For there is hope for a tree,<br>
if it is cut down, that it will sprout again,<br>
and that its shoots will not cease.<br>
Though its root grows old in the earth,<br>
and its stump dies in the ground,<br>
yet at the scent of water it will bud<br>
and put forth branches like a young plant.<br>
But mortals die, and are laid low;<br>
humans expire, and where are they?<br>
As waters fail from a lake,<br>
and a river wastes away and dries up,<br>
so mortals lie down and do not rise again;<br>
until the heavens are no more, they will not awake<br>
or be roused out of their sleep.<br>
O that you would hide me in Sheol,<br>
that you would conceal me until your wrath is past,<br>
that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!<br>
If mortals die, will they live again?<br>
All the days of my service I would wait<br>
until my release should come.</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-126">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
<p>Since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.</p>
<p>The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
<p>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &ldquo;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, &lsquo;After three days I will rise again.&rsquo; Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, &lsquo;He has been raised from the dead,&rsquo; and the last deception would be worse than the first.&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&rdquo; So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</p>

<p>Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died. For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</p>

<p>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&rsquo; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.</p>
<p>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

<p>Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose NAME was Cleopas, answered him, &ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&rdquo; He asked them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.</p>
<p>As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p>While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.</p>
<p>Then he said to them, &ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the multitude, &ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know&ndash; this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;<br>
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.<br>
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.<br>
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.</p>

<p>Jesus met Mary Magdalene and the other Mary and said, &ldquo;Greetings!&rdquo; And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them, &ldquo;You must say, &lsquo;His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&rsquo; If this comes to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&rdquo; So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.</p>

For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.&rdquo; And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&rdquo; So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

<p>One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms. Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, &ldquo;Look at us.&rdquo; And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, &ldquo;I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk.&rdquo; And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him</p>

<p>Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, &ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&rdquo; He asked them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.</p>
<p>As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&rdquo; So he went in to stay with them.

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>While the lame man whom Peter and John had healed clung to them, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon&rsquo;s Portico, utterly astonished. When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, &ldquo;You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus, who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets. Moses said, &lsquo;The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you. And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.&rsquo; And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days. You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, &lsquo;And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&rsquo; When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them, much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead. So they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who heard the word believed; and they numbered about five thousand.</p>
<p>The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, &ldquo;By what power or by what name did you do this?&rdquo; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead.

<p>Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We will go with you.&rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p>Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&rdquo; They answered him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>

<p>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus. When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another. They said, ‘What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it. But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.’ So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered them, ‘Whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.’ After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.</p>

After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.

The high priest questioned them, saying, &ldquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man&rsquo;s blood on us.&rdquo; But Peter and the apostles answered, &ldquo;We must obey God rather than any human authority. The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

<p>When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&rdquo; Thomas answered him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.</p>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&rdquo; The reply came, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&rdquo; [The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p>
<p>Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo; The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&rdquo; But Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.&rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel; I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&rdquo; So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his strength.</p>
<p>For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &ldquo;He is the Son of God.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We will go with you.&rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p>Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&rdquo; They answered him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<p>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo; A second time he said to him, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Tend my sheep.&rdquo; He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.&rdquo; (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, &ldquo;Please come to us without delay.&rdquo; So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, &ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&rdquo; Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.</p>

There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. I also heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Get up, Peter; kill and eat.&rsquo; But I replied, &lsquo;By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&rsquo; But a second time the voice answered from heaven, &lsquo;What God has made clean, you must not call profane.&rsquo; This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven. At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were. The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s house. He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, &lsquo;Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter; he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.&rsquo; And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, &lsquo;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo; If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?&rdquo; When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, &ldquo;Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes.

<p>And the one who was seated on the throne said, &ldquo;See, I am making all things new.&rdquo; Also he said, &ldquo;Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;It is done!

<p>During the night Paul had a vision: there stood a man of Macedonia pleading with him and saying, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo; When he had seen the vision, we immediately tried to cross over to Macedonia, being convinced that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.</p>
<p>We set sail from Troas and took a straight course to Samothrace, the following day to Neapolis, and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days. On the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there. A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home.&rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.</p>

<p>In the spirit the angel carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.</p>
<p>I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never be shut by day&ndash; and there will be no night there. People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.</p>
<p>Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.</p>

<p>In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is what you have heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So when they had come together, they asked him, &ldquo;Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo; When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, &ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&rdquo;</p>

I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>

<p>With Paul and Silas, we came to Philippi in Macedonia, a Roman colony, and, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling. While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, &ldquo;These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.&rdquo; She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &ldquo;I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&rdquo; And it came out that very hour.</p>
<p>But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, &ldquo;These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe.&rdquo; The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods. After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely. Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>
<p>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were unfastened. When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul shouted in a loud voice, &ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&rdquo; The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them outside and said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay. He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.</p>

And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them.

<p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?

Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.<br>
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.<br>

Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever.

If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ&ndash;whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.

<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Someone will ask, &ldquo;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?&rdquo; Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.</p>
<p>So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, &ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living being&rdquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.</p>
<p>What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</p>

If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listen, I will tell you a mystery! We will not all die, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.</p>

<p>Jesus told the people a parable: &ldquo;Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher. Why do you see the speck in your neighbor&rsquo;s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, &lsquo;Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,&rsquo; when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; and do not do what I tell you? I will show you what someone is like who comes to me, hears my words, and acts on them. That one is like a man building a house, who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when a flood arose, the river burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it, immediately it fell, and great was the ruin of that house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reading from first Kings.</p>
<p>Ahab sent to all the Israelites, and assembled the prophets at Mount Carmel. Elijah then came near to all the people, and said, &ldquo;How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.&rdquo; The people did not answer him a word. [Then Elijah said to the people, &ldquo;I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal&rsquo;s prophets number four hundred fifty. Let two bulls be given to us; let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the LORD; the god who answers by fire is indeed God.&rdquo; All the people answered, &ldquo;Well spoken!&rdquo; Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, &ldquo;Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; then call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.&rdquo; So they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, crying, &ldquo;O Baal, answer us!&rdquo; But there was no voice, and no answer. They limped about the altar that they had made. At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, &ldquo;Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&rdquo; Then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them. As midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice, no answer, and no response.]</p>
<p>Then Elijah said to all the people, &ldquo;Come closer to me&rdquo;; and all the people came closer to him. First he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down; Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, &ldquo;Israel shall be your name&rdquo;; with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed. Next he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, &ldquo;Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Do it a second time&rdquo;; and they did it a second time. Again he said, &ldquo;Do it a third time&rdquo;; and they did it a third time, so that the water ran all around the altar, and filled the trench also with water.</p>
<p>At the time of the offering of the oblation, the prophet Elijah came near and said, &ldquo;O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your bidding. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.&rdquo; Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the trench. When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, &ldquo;The LORD indeed is God; the LORD indeed is God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the churches of Galatia:</p>

<p>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&ndash; not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are confusing you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that one be accursed! As we have said before, so now I repeat, if anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that one be accursed!</p>
<p>Am I now seeking human approval, or God&rsquo;s approval? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still pleasing people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>

<p>After Jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. A centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly, and who was ill and close to death. When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his slave. When they came to Jesus, they appealed to him earnestly, saying, &ldquo;He is worthy of having you do this for him, for he loves our people, and it is he who built our synagogue for us.&rdquo; And Jesus went with them, but when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, &ldquo;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; therefore I did not presume to come to you. But only speak the word, and let my servant be healed. For I also am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; and he goes, and to another, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; and he comes, and to my slave, &lsquo;Do this,&rsquo; and the slave does it.&rdquo; When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, he said, &ldquo;I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.&rdquo; When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.</p>

<p>The word of the LORD came to Elijah, saying, &ldquo;Go now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live there; for I have commanded a widow there to feed you.&rdquo; So he set out and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, a widow was there gathering sticks; he called to her and said, &ldquo;Bring me a little water in a vessel, so that I may drink.&rdquo; As she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, &ldquo;Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&rdquo; But she said, &ldquo;As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&rdquo; Elijah said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son. For thus says the LORD the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.&rdquo; She went and did as Elijah said, so that she as well as he and her household ate for many days. The jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.</p>
<p>[After this, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house at Zarephath, became ill; his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. She then said to Elijah, &ldquo;What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!&rdquo; But he said to her, &ldquo;Give me your son.&rdquo; He took him from her bosom, carried him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging, and laid him on his own bed. He cried out to the LORD, &ldquo;O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?&rdquo; Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to the LORD, &ldquo;O LORD my God, let this child&rsquo;s life come into him again.&rdquo; The LORD listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived. Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; then Elijah said, &ldquo;See, your son is alive.&rdquo; So the woman said to Elijah, &ldquo;Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p>Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days; but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord&rsquo;s brother. In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ; they only heard it said, &ldquo;The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.&rdquo; And they glorified God because of me.</p>

<p>A reading from first Kings.</p>
<p>The following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. And Ahab said to Naboth, &ldquo;Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.&rdquo; But Naboth said to Ahab, &ldquo;The LORD forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance.&rdquo; Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, &ldquo;I will not give you my ancestral inheritance.&rdquo; He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat.</p>
<p>His wife Jezebel came to him and said, &ldquo;Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?&rdquo; He said to her, &ldquo;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, &lsquo;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it&rsquo;; but he answered, &lsquo;I will not give you my vineyard.&rsquo;&rdquo; His wife Jezebel said to him, &ldquo;Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she wrote letters in Ahab&rsquo;s name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. She wrote in the letters, &ldquo;Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly; seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, &lsquo;You have cursed God and the king.&rsquo; Then take him out, and stone him to death.&rdquo; [The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly. The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &ldquo;Naboth cursed God and the king.&rdquo; So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &ldquo;Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, &ldquo;Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&rdquo; As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. You shall say to him, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: Have you killed, and also taken possession?&rdquo; You shall say to him, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahab said to Elijah, &ldquo;Have you found me, O my enemy?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, I will bring disaster on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law. But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor. For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</p>

<p>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee&rsquo;s house and took his place at the table. And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, &ldquo;If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him&ndash; that she is a sinner.&rdquo; Jesus spoke up and said to him, &ldquo;Simon, I have something to say to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Speak.&rdquo; &ldquo;A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?&rdquo; Simon answered, &ldquo;I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.&rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have judged rightly.&rdquo; Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, &ldquo;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.&rdquo; Then he said to her, &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven.&rdquo; But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, &ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&rdquo; And he said to the woman, &ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Herod&rsquo;s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources.</p>

<p>Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &ldquo;So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&rdquo; Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.</p>
<p>But he himself went a day&rsquo;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: &ldquo;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.&rdquo; [Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, &ldquo;Get up and eat.&rdquo; He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel of the LORD came a second time, touched him, and said, &ldquo;Get up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.&rdquo;] He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.&rdquo; Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to him, &ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to the promise.</p>

<p>Jesus and his disciples arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. As he stepped out on land, a man of the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice, &ldquo;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me&rdquo; &ndash; for Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds.) Jesus then asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo;; for many demons had entered him. They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss.</p>
<p>Now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</p>
<p>When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, &ldquo;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&rdquo; So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.</p>

<p>When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.&rdquo; But Elisha said, &ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p>Then Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.</p>
<p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.&rdquo; Elisha said, &ldquo;Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.&rdquo; As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, &ldquo;Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo; But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</p>
<p>He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, &ldquo;Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&rdquo; When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>
<p>For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.</p>
<p>Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.</p>

<p>Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from leprosy. Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman&rsquo;s wife. She said to her mistress, &ldquo;If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.&rdquo; So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said. And the king of Aram said, &ldquo;Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments. He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, &ldquo;When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy.&rdquo; When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, &ldquo;Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, &ldquo;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel.&rdquo; So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the entrance of Elisha&rsquo;s house. Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &ldquo;Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.&rdquo; But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, &ldquo;I thought that for me he would surely come out, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and would wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy! Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?&rdquo; He turned and went away in a rage. But his servants approached and said to him, &ldquo;Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, &lsquo;Wash, and be clean&rsquo;?&rdquo; So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow. If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit. So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest-time, if we do not give up. So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.</p>
<p>See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand! It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised&ndash; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh. May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything! As for those who will follow this rule&ndash; peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>

<p>The Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go. He said to them, &ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, &lsquo;Peace to this house!&rsquo; And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person; but if not, it will return to you. Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the sick who are there, and say to them, &lsquo;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&rsquo; But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, &lsquo;Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seventy returned with joy, saying, &ldquo;Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. And the LORD said to me, &ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;A plumb line.&rdquo; Then the Lord said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass them by;<br>
the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. For thus Amos has said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And Amaziah said to Amos, &ldquo;O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there; but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king&rsquo;s sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Amos answered Amaziah, &ldquo;I am no prophet, nor a prophet&rsquo;s son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, &lsquo;Go, prophesy to my people Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now therefore hear the word of the LORD.<br>
You say, &lsquo;Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.&rsquo;<br>
Therefore thus says the LORD:<br>
&lsquo;Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line;<br>
you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father.</p>
<p>In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God. This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf, and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p>For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God. May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>

<p>Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;What is written in the law? What do you read there?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, &ldquo;And who is my neighbor?&rdquo; Jesus replied, &ldquo;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, &lsquo;Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.&rsquo; Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;The one who showed him mercy.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>

The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD;<br>
&ldquo;the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!&rdquo;<br>

We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,<br>
buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat.&rdquo;<br>
The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:<br>
Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.<br>
Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it,<br>
and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?<br>
On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.<br>
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation;<br>
I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head;<br>
I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.<br>
The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land;<br>
not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.<br>
They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east;<br>
they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-230">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</p>
<p>And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him&ndash; provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.</p>
<p>I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ&rsquo;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church. I became its servant according to God&rsquo;s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.</p>

<p>As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
<p>See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p>[Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths. These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.]</p>

<p>Father, hallowed be your name.<br>

Give us each day our daily bread.<br>

<p>&ldquo;So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="lector-238">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.</p>
<p>Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life. But now you must get rid of all such things&ndash; anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator. In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!</p>

<p>Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, &ldquo;Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.&rdquo; But he said to him, &ldquo;Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one&rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&rdquo; Then he told them a parable: &ldquo;The land of a rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, &lsquo;What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?&rsquo; Then he said, &lsquo;I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.

<blockquote>
<p>Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom!<br>
Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!<br>
What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord;<br>
I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts;<br>
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.<br>
When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;<br>
bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me.<br>
New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation&ndash; I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.<br>
Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;<br>
they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.<br>
When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;<br>
even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.<br>
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes;<br>
cease to do evil, learn to do good;<br>
seek justice, rescue the oppressed,<br>
defend the orphan, plead for the widow.<br>
Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord:<br>
though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow;<br>
though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.<br>
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;<br>
but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.</p>
<p>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, &ldquo;as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.</p>

<p>Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them. If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.</p>

I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured;<br>

<p>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned. By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days. By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.</p>
<p>And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets&ndash; who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented&ndash; of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</p>
<p>Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from us, be made perfect.</p>
<p>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>

<p>You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them. (For they could not endure the order that was given, &ldquo;If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.&rdquo; Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, &ldquo;I tremble with fear.&rdquo;) But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.</p>

<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Let mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured. Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, &ldquo;I will never leave you or forsake you.&rdquo; So we can say with confidence,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.<br>
What can anyone do to me?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</p>
<p>Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were watching him closely.</p>
<p>When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. &ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, &lsquo;Give this person your place,&rsquo; and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, &lsquo;Friend, move up higher&rsquo;; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said also to the one who had invited him, &ldquo;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: &ldquo;Come, go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will let you hear my words.&rdquo; So I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there he was working at his wheel. The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&rsquo;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to me: Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the LORD. Just like the clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.</p>

<h5 id="lector-258">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to Philemon.</p>
<p>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus. I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ. I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.</p>
<p>For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty, yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love&ndash; and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother&ndash; especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p>So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</p>

<p>Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus; and he turned and said to them, &ldquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, &lsquo;This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.&rsquo; Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&rdquo;</p>

When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.

So he summoned him and said to him, &lsquo;What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.&rsquo; Then the manager said to himself, &lsquo;What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.&rsquo; So, summoning his master&rsquo;s debtors one by one, he asked the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;A hundred jugs of olive oil.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.&rsquo; Then he asked another, &lsquo;And how much do you owe?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;A hundred containers of wheat.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill and make it eighty.&rsquo; And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is great gain in godliness combined with contentment; for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it; but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.</p>
<p>But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will bring about at the right time&ndash; he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords. It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</p>
<p>As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores. The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.&rsquo; But Abraham said, &lsquo;Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father&rsquo;s house&ndash; for I have five brothers&ndash; that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.&rsquo; Abraham replied, &lsquo;They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude;<br>
she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place;<br>
her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress.<br>
The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals;<br>
all her gates are desolate, her priests groan;<br>

<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, for the sake of the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>To Timothy, my beloved child:</p>
<p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p>I am grateful to God&ndash; whom I worship with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did&ndash; when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.</p>
<p>Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God, who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher, and for this reason I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that day what I have entrusted to him. Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Guard the good treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit living in us.</p>

Keeping their distance, they called out, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&rdquo; When he saw them, he said to them, &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; And as they went, they were made clean. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus&rsquo; feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, &ldquo;Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they?

<p>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.</p>

I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.<br>
Then the LORD answered me and said:<br>
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.<br>
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.<br>
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.<br>
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, &ldquo;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.&rdquo; So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, &ldquo;He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.&rdquo; Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, &ldquo;Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.&rdquo;</p>

How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing? Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts, according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear. For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts. The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.</p>

Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed, the one destined for destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?</p>
<p>But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth. For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</p>
<p>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope, comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.</p>

<p>Some Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him a question, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first married, and died childless; then the second and the third married her, and so in the same way all seven died childless. Finally the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had married her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. Indeed they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed, in the story about the bush, where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Now he is God not of the dead, but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.&rdquo;</p>

For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, and we did not eat anyone&rsquo;s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you. This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”</p></blockquote>
<p>(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p>
<p>But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.</p>
<p>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for</p>

<p>As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</p>

<p>Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”</p>
<p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me?

<h5 id="lector-312">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the LORD: Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD&rsquo;s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD; speak to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word. It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their evil doings. You shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently&ndash; though you have not heeded&ndash; then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, &ldquo;You shall die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, &lsquo;This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant&rsquo;?&rdquo; And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, &ldquo;It is the LORD who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against you. But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and others of those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated some men to say, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&rdquo; They stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes; then they suddenly confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council. They set up false witnesses who said, &ldquo;This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed on to us.&rdquo; And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p>
<p>Then the high priest asked him, &ldquo;Are these things so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Stephen replied: &ldquo;Brothers and fathers, listen to me. You are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do. Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers. You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen. But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&rdquo; But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&rdquo; Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&rdquo; When he had said this, he died.</p>

<p>When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Paul said to King Agrippa, &ldquo;Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death. By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;Who are you, Lord?&rsquo; The Lord answered, &lsquo;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you. I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles&ndash; to whom I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance. For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin; for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p>Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days; but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord&rsquo;s brother. In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ; they only heard it said, &ldquo;The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.&rdquo; And they glorified God because of me.</p>

<p>Since God&rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>

<p>When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;<br>
for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And the child&rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>The promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.</p>
<p>For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, &ldquo;I have made you the father of many nations&rdquo;) &ndash; in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become &ldquo;the father of many nations,&rdquo; according to what was said, &ldquo;So numerous shall your descendants be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parents of Jesus went to Jerusalem every year for the festival of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival. When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day&rsquo;s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, &ldquo;Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; But they did not understand what he said to them. Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.</p>
<p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;<br>

Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).”</p></blockquote>
<p>When he said above, &ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.

<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p>

We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people&rsquo;s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body&rsquo;s growth in building itself up in love.</p>

<p>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;<br>
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: &lsquo;Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, &ldquo;The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.</p>
<p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.&rdquo;</p>

We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.

<p>Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.</p>
<p>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.</p>

<p>In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mary said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br>
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br>
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.<br>
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.<br>
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.<br>
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;<br>
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.<br>
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.</p>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews. But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion; for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”</p>
<p>At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p>
<p>Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the twelve, “As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</p>

<p>On the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”</p>
<p>So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: “You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’ Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised; before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.”</p>

<p>The time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father. But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.” They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.” Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him. He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God. Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea. All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
<p>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favourably on his people and redeemed them.<br>
He has raised up a mighty saviour for us in the house of his servant David,<br>
as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.<br>
Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant,<br>
the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,<br>
might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.”<br>
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br>
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us,<br>
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p></blockquote>

By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, “as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.”</p>
<p>All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.</p>

For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</p>

<p>Judith prostrated herself, put ashes on her head, and uncovered the sackcloth she was wearing. At the very time when the evening incense was being offered in the house of God in Jerusalem, Judith cried out to the Lord with a loud voice, and said, “Your strength does not depend on numbers, nor your might on the powerful. But you are the God of the lowly, helper of the oppressed, upholder of the weak, protector of the forsaken, savior of those without hope. Please, please, God of my father, God of the heritage of Israel, Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of the waters, King of all your creation, hear my prayer! Make my deceitful words bring wound and bruise on those who have planned cruel things against your covenant, and against your sacred house, and against Mount Zion, and against the house your children possess. Let your whole nation and every tribe know and understand that you are God, the God of all power and might, and that there is no other who protects the people of Israel but you alone!”</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them.</p>
<p>From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</p>

Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

<p>I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory, since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.</p>
<p>For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.</p>
<p>So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one&rsquo;s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</p>

<p>Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” —not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.</p>

<h5 id="lector-394">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.</p>
<p>I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</p>

<p>A dispute arose among the disciples as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</p>
<p>“You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</p>

The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”</p>

<p>Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”</p>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>All the apostles and elders kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, “My brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first looked favorably on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name. This agrees with the words of the prophets, as it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘After this I will return,<br>
and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; from its ruins I will rebuild it, and I will set it up,<br>
so that all other peoples may seek the Lord&ndash; even all the Gentiles over whom my name has been called.<br>
Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things known from long ago.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood. For in every city, for generations past, Moses has had those who proclaim him, for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues.”</p>
<p>Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.</p>

<p><em>Beatus vir qui non abiit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *<br>
nor lingered in the way of sinners,<br>
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!<br>
<strong>2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *<br>
and they meditate on his law day and night.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,<br>
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *<br>
everything they do shall prosper.<br>
<strong>4	It is not so with the wicked; *<br>
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *<br>
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.<br>
<strong>6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *<br>
but the way of the wicked is doomed.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.</p>
<p>For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.</p>

<p>Jesus came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power? Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?” And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.” And he did not do many deeds of power there, because of their unbelief.</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>Now in Christ Jesus you Gentiles, who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.</p>

<p>Jesus said to his disciples, “I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.</p>
<p>“If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you. If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world&ndash; therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘Servants are not greater than their master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’</p>
<p>“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.”</p>

<p>In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.</p>
<p>As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.</p>
<p>I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>

“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.<br>

When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God.
