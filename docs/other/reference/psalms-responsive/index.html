<p>These Psalms are from the Book of Common Prayer (1979/2007). They are formatted for reading responsively by verse.</p>
<h3 id="psalm-1">Psalm 1</h3>
<p><em>Beatus vir qui non abiit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *<br>
nor lingered in the way of sinners,<br>
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!<br>
<strong>2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *<br>
and they meditate on his law day and night.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,<br>
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *<br>
everything they do shall prosper.<br>
<strong>4	It is not so with the wicked; *<br>
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *<br>
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.<br>
<strong>6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *<br>
but the way of the wicked is doomed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-2">Psalm 2</h3>
<p><em>Quare fremuerunt gentes?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *<br>
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?<br>
<strong>2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,<br>
and the princes plot together, *<br>
against the LORD and against his Anointed?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	&ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&rdquo; they say; *<br>
&ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *<br>
the Lord has them in derision.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *<br>
and his rage fills them with terror.<br>
<strong>6	&ldquo;I myself have set my king *<br>
upon my holy hill of Zion.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: *<br>
he said to me, &ldquo;You are my Son;<br>
this day have I begotten you.<br>
<strong>8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for<br>
your inheritance *<br>
and the ends of the earth for your possession.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	You shall crush them with an iron rod *<br>
and shatter them like a piece of pottery.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>10	And now, you kings, be wise; *<br>
be warned, you rulers of the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Submit to the LORD with fear, *<br>
and with trembling bow before him;<br>
<strong>12	Lest he be angry and you perish; *<br>
for his wrath is quickly kindled.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Happy are they all *<br>
who take refuge in him!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-3">Psalm 3</h3>
<p><em>Domine, quid multiplicati</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	LORD, how many adversaries I have! *<br>
how many there are who rise up against me!<br>
<strong>2	How many there are who say of me, *<br>
&ldquo;There is no help for him in his God.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	But you, O LORD, are a shield about me; *<br>
you are my glory, the one who lifts up my head.<br>
<strong>4	I call aloud upon the LORD, *<br>
and he answers me from his holy hill;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	I lie down and go to sleep; *<br>
I wake again, because the LORD sustains me.<br>
<strong>6	I do not fear the multitudes of people *<br>
who set themselves against me all around.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Rise up, O LORD; set me free, O my God; *<br>
surely, you will strike all my enemies across the face,<br>
you will break the teeth of the wicked.<br>
<strong>8	Deliverance belongs to the LORD. *<br>
Your blessing be upon your people!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-4">Psalm 4</h3>
<p><em>Cum invocarem</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *<br>
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;<br>
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.<br>
<strong>2	&ldquo;You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *<br>
how long will you worship dumb idols<br>
and run after false gods?&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *<br>
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.<br>
<strong>4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; *<br>
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Offer the appointed sacrifices *<br>
and put your trust in the LORD.<br>
<strong>6	Many are saying,<br>
&ldquo;Oh, that we might see better times!&rdquo; *<br>
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You have put gladness in my heart, *<br>
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.<br>
<strong>8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *<br>
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-5">Psalm 5</h3>
<p><em>Verba mea auribus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Give ear to my words, O LORD; *<br>
consider my meditation.<br>
<strong>2	Hearken to my cry for help, my King and my God, *<br>
for I make my prayer to you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; *<br>
early in the morning I make my appeal and watch for you.<br>
<strong>4	For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, *<br>
and evil cannot dwell with you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Braggarts cannot stand in your sight; *<br>
you hate all those who work wickedness.<br>
<strong>6	You destroy those who speak lies; *<br>
the bloodthirsty and deceitful, O LORD, you abhor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy I will go into your house; *<br>
I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.<br>
<strong>8	Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness,<br>
because of those who lie in wait for me; *<br>
make your way straight before me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	For there is no truth in their mouth; *<br>
there is destruction in their heart;<br>
<strong>10	Their throat is an open grave; *<br>
they flatter with their tongue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Declare them guilty, O God; *<br>
let them fall, because of their schemes.<br>
<strong>12	Because of their many transgressions cast them out, *<br>
for they have rebelled against you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	But all who take refuge in you will be glad; *<br>
they will sing out their joy for ever.<br>
<strong>14	You will shelter them, *<br>
so that those who love your Name may exult in you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	For you, O LORD, will bless the righteous; *<br>
you will defend them with your favor as with a shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-6">Psalm 6</h3>
<p><em>Domine, ne in furore</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; *<br>
do not punish me in your wrath.<br>
<strong>2	Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak; *<br>
heal me, LORD, for my bones are racked.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	My spirit shakes with terror; *<br>
how long, O LORD, how long?<br>
<strong>4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; *<br>
save me for your mercy&rsquo;s sake.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	For in death no one remembers you; *<br>
and who will give you thanks in the grave?<br>
<strong>6	I grow weary because of my groaning; *<br>
every night I drench my bed<br>
and flood my couch with tears.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	My eyes are wasted with grief *<br>
and worn away because of all my enemies.<br>
<strong>8	Depart from me, all evildoers, *<br>
for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The LORD has heard my supplication; *<br>
the LORD accepts my prayer.<br>
<strong>10	All my enemies shall be confounded and quake with fear; *<br>
they shall turn back and suddenly be put to shame.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-7">Psalm 7</h3>
<p><em>Domine, Deus meus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; *<br>
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;<br>
<strong>2	Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *<br>
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	O LORD my God, if I have done these things: *<br>
if there is any wickedness in my hands,<br>
<strong>4	If I have repaid my friend with evil, *<br>
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *<br>
trample my life into the ground,<br>
and lay my honor in the dust.<br>
<strong>6	Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; *<br>
rise up against the fury of my enemies.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Awake, O my God, decree justice; *<br>
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.<br>
<strong>8	Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *<br>
O LORD, judge the nations.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Give judgment for me according to my righteousness, O LORD, *<br>
and according to my innocence, O Most High.<br>
<strong>10	Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,<br>
but establish the righteous; *<br>
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	God is my shield and defense; *<br>
he is the savior of the true in heart.<br>
<strong>12	God is a righteous judge; *<br>
God sits in judgment every day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	If they will not repent, God will whet his sword; *<br>
he will bend his bow and make it ready.<br>
<strong>14	He has prepared his weapons of death; *<br>
he makes his arrows shafts of fire.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Look at those who are in labor with wickedness, *<br>
who conceive evil, and give birth to a lie.<br>
<strong>16	They dig a pit and make it deep *<br>
and fall into the hole that they have made.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	Their malice turns back upon their own head; *<br>
their violence falls on their own scalp.<br>
<strong>18	I will bear witness that the LORD is righteous; *<br>
I will praise the Name of the LORD Most High.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-8">Psalm 8</h3>
<p><em>Domine, Dominus noster</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	O LORD our Governor, *<br>
how exalted is your Name in all the world!<br>
<strong>2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *<br>
your majesty is praised above the heavens.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *<br>
to quell the enemy and the avenger.<br>
<strong>4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *<br>
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *<br>
the son of man that you should seek him out?<br>
<strong>6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *<br>
you adorn him with glory and honor;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *<br>
you put all things under his feet:<br>
<strong>8	All sheep and oxen, *<br>
even the wild beasts of the field,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *<br>
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.<br>
<strong>10	O LORD our Governor, *<br>
how exalted is your Name in all the world!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-9">Psalm 9</h3>
<p><em>Confitebor tibi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *<br>
I will tell of all your marvelous works.<br>
<strong>2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; *<br>
I will sing to your Name, O Most High.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	When my enemies are driven back, *<br>
they will stumble and perish at your presence.<br>
<strong>4	For you have maintained my right and my cause; *<br>
you sit upon your throne judging right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *<br>
you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.<br>
<strong>6	As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *<br>
their cities plowed under, the memory of them perished;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	But the LORD is enthroned for ever; *<br>
he has set up his throne for judgment.<br>
<strong>8	It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *<br>
he judges the peoples with equity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, *<br>
a refuge in time of trouble.<br>
<strong>10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *<br>
for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; *<br>
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.<br>
<strong>12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; *<br>
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Have pity on me, O LORD; *<br>
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,<br>
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;<br>
<strong>14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation *<br>
in the gates of the city of Zion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *<br>
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.<br>
<strong>16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; *<br>
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *<br>
and also all the people that forget God.<br>
<strong>18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *<br>
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *<br>
let them be judged before you.<br>
<strong>20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; *<br>
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-10">Psalm 10</h3>
<p><em>Ut quid, Domine?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Why do you stand so far off, O LORD, *<br>
and hide yourself in time of trouble?<br>
<strong>2	The wicked arrogantly persecute the poor, *<br>
but they are trapped in the schemes they have devised.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	The wicked boast of their heart&rsquo;s desire; *<br>
the covetous curse and revile the LORD.<br>
<strong>4	The wicked are so proud that they care not for God; *<br>
their only thought is, &ldquo;God does not matter.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Their ways are devious at all times;<br>
your judgments are far above out of their sight; *<br>
they defy all their enemies.<br>
<strong>6	They say in their heart, &ldquo;I shall not be shaken; *<br>
no harm shall happen to me ever.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Their mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression; *<br>
under their tongue are mischief and wrong.<br>
<strong>8	They lurk in ambush in public squares<br>
and in secret places they murder the innocent; *<br>
they spy out the helpless.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	They lie in wait, like a lion in a covert;<br>
they lie in wait to seize upon the lowly; *<br>
they seize the lowly and drag them away in their net.<br>
<strong>10	The innocent are broken and humbled before them; *<br>
the helpless fall before their power.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	They say in their heart, &ldquo;God has forgotten; *<br>
he hides his face; he will never notice.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>12	Rise up, O LORD;<br>
lift up your hand, O God; *<br>
do not forget the afflicted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Why should the wicked revile God? *<br>
why should they say in their heart, &ldquo;You do not care&rdquo;?<br>
<strong>14	Surely, you behold trouble and misery; *<br>
you see it and take it into your own hand.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	The helpless commit themselves to you, *<br>
for you are the helper of orphans.<br>
<strong>16	Break the power of the wicked and evil; *<br>
search out their wickedness until you find none.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	The LORD is King for ever and ever; *<br>
the ungodly shall perish from his land.<br>
<strong>18	The LORD will hear the desire of the humble; *<br>
you will strengthen their heart and your ears shall hear;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	To give justice to the orphan and oppressed, *<br>
so that mere mortals may strike terror no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-11">Psalm 11</h3>
<p><em>In Domino confido</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	In the LORD have I taken refuge; *<br>
how then can you say to me,<br>
&ldquo;Fly away like a bird to the hilltop;<br>
<strong>2	For see how the wicked bend the bow<br>
and fit their arrows to the string, *<br>
to shoot from ambush at the true of heart.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	When the foundations are being destroyed, *<br>
what can the righteous do?&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	The LORD is in his holy temple; *<br>
the LORD&rsquo;S throne is in heaven.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	His eyes behold the inhabited world; *<br>
his piercing eye weighs our worth.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD weighs the righteous as well as the wicked, *<br>
but those who delight in violence he abhors.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Upon the wicked he shall rain coals of fire and burning sulphur; *<br>
a scorching wind shall be their lot.<br>
<strong>8	For the LORD is righteous;<br>
he delights in righteous deeds; *<br>
and the just shall see his face.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-12">Psalm 12</h3>
<p><em>Salvum me fac</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Help me, LORD, for there is no godly one left; *<br>
the faithful have vanished from among us.<br>
<strong>2	Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *<br>
with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Oh, that the LORD would cut off all smooth tongues, *<br>
and close the lips that utter proud boasts!<br>
<strong>4	Those who say, &ldquo;With our tongue will we prevail; *<br>
our lips are our own; who is lord over us?&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	&ldquo;Because the needy are oppressed,<br>
and the poor cry out in misery, *<br>
I will rise up,&rdquo; says the LORD,<br>
&ldquo;and give them the help they long for.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>6	The words of the LORD are pure words, *<br>
like silver refined from ore<br>
and purified seven times in the fire.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	O LORD, watch over us *<br>
and save us from this generation for ever.<br>
<strong>8	The wicked prowl on every side, *<br>
and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-13">Psalm 13</h3>
<p><em>Usquequo, Domine?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	How long, O LORD?<br>
will you forget me for ever? *<br>
how long will you hide your face from me?<br>
<strong>2	How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,<br>
and grief in my heart, day after day? *<br>
how long shall my enemy triumph over me?</strong></p>
