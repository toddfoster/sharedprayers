<p>Introduction (said at the foot of the altar)</p>
<h5 id="leader">Leader:</h5>
<p>Let us pray the Way of the Cross with a humble and contrite heart, after all it is because of our sins that Jesus had to die for us. Every step of the way to death was made in agony of pain, and every step made in ecstasy of love.</p>
<h5 id="all"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus Christ, take me along that holy way you once took to your death. Take my mind, my memory, above all my reluctant heart, and let me see what once you did for love of me and all the world. The Son of God died the criminal&rsquo;s death in love, that we may live in God&rsquo;s mercy, that we may die in His Eternal love. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, You so lovingly responded to Veronica’s compassion, by letting the Image of Your Holy Face remain on her veil. The Image revealed such suffering of pain and such beauty of love!</p>

<p><strong>Jesus, impress upon my soul the image of Your Holy Face, may the beauty penetrate my life and take away any ugliness within me. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, You were so weak you fell again on Your poor knees and hand already grazed and bleeding. Then You were pulled up and pushed on, still with that terrible Cross, yet You made it a Cross of love and bore such weakness for us.</p>
<h5 id="people-13">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, Your weakness then is now our strength; our hearts are made strong in faith and hope, because of Your love for us. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, You remembered the children whom You loved to come to You, as You raised Your aching head and looked with compassion on mothers of little ones - the women of Jerusalem, who wept for You. You blessed them and told them to weep only for themselves and for their children.</p>
<h5 id="people-15">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, bless us as we weep for those who suffer for their children and for the children who suffer without love. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, how terrible must have been Your last fall, the whole of Your Body in pain and all Your strength gone. Simon needed all his strength to stop the cross falling on You. Though numbed with exhaustion the fire of Your love for us was unquenched and with utmost giving You made the last painful steps of Your human life.</p>
<h5 id="people-17">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, Your love was and is more than all the suffering and sorrow. This is the sign of hope to those who are in despair. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="people-19">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, our souls are naked before God, no adornment can hide our sins. Our only clothing is Your merciful love, our only hope of dignity is in Your sacrifice for us. Amen</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, Your hands that blessed and healed and fed the hungry were nailed to the Cross. Your feet that walked so many weary miles to preach the Divine Word, were nailed to the Cross. But You did not need to be nailed, You stretched out Your aching limbs on the hard wood and they were held there by love.</p>
<h5 id="people-21">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, help us to feel not bound but only held in love to the cross- es of this life. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, as the Cross was raised Your poor body sank and every nerve-ending in Your hands and feet were torn by the nails. You were alone in the terrible darkness with only the tear stained face of Your agonized Mother to comfort You. Your disciple standing by was numbed and bewildered. Even their comfort You gave away in love, asking them to care for each other. Your terrible cry “It is finished” completed the sacrifice.</p>
<h5 id="people-23">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, how can I recompense such rejection? How can I show enough gratitude for such love? but it is enough that I know, to let you just hold my life in Your love. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus, as Your sorrowing Mother received Your body from the Cross, the sword of old Simeon’s prophecy pierced the depths of her being. As she tenderly held Your wounded body, did she not remember You as the Babe in her womb, her Infant Child, and her Boy growing up? Mary must have remembered the crowds following You for Your teaching but through her sobbing remembered the crowds that cried “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!&quot;</p>
<h5 id="people-25">People:</h5>
<p><strong>Jesus, may the merits of Your dear Mother’s deep sorrow help us as we pray for all mothers who sorrow for their children, for all who lose dear ones through violence. Amen.</strong></p>
