<p>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, &ldquo;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&rdquo; He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress. Then he said to them, &ldquo;My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.&rdquo; He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.&rdquo; When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, &ldquo;So you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Then, while [Jesus] was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying, &ldquo;the man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away securely.&rdquo; He came and immediately went over to him and said, &ldquo;Rabbi.&rdquo; And he kissed him. At this they laid hands on him and arrested him.<br>

<h5 id="reader-2"><strong>Reader:</strong></h5>
<p>When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin. They said, &ldquo;If you are the Messiah, tell us,&rdquo; but he replied to them, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I question, you will not respond. But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&rdquo; They all asked, &ldquo;Are you then the Son of God?&rdquo; He replied to them, &ldquo;You say that I am.&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.&rdquo;<br>

<h5 id="reader-3"><strong>Reader:</strong></h5>
<p>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the maids came over to him and said, &ldquo;You too were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo; But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, &ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about!&rdquo; As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, &ldquo;This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.&rdquo; Again he denied it with an oath, &ldquo;I do not know the man!&rdquo; A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter, &ldquo;Surely you too are one of them; even your speech gives you away.&rdquo; At that he began to curse and to swear, &ldquo;I do not know the man.&rdquo; And immediately a cock crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: &ldquo;Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.&rdquo; He went out and began to weep bitterly.<br>

Pilate questioned him, &ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&rdquo; He said to him in reply, &ldquo;You say so.&rdquo; The chief priests accused him of many things. Again Pilate questioned him, &ldquo;Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.&rdquo; Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed&hellip;. Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barrabas&hellip; [and] handed [Jesus] over to be crucified.<br>

<p>When the chief priests and the guards saw [Jesus] they cried out, &ldquo;Crucify him, crucify him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.&rdquo; &hellip; They cried out, &ldquo;Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!&rdquo; Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Shall I crucify your king?&rdquo; The chief priests answered, &ldquo;We have no king but Caesar.&rdquo; Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.<br>

<h5 id="reader-8"><strong>Reader:</strong></h5>
<p>A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, &lsquo;Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.&rsquo; At that time, people will say to the mountains, &lsquo;Fall upon us!&rsquo; and to the hills, &lsquo;Cover us!&rsquo; for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?&rdquo;<br>

And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&rdquo; He replied to him, &ldquo;Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;<br>

<h1 id="what-was-the-cross-of-jesus-like">What was the cross of Jesus like?</h1>
<p>Just as Jesus was at the center of the cross when He was crucified, so the cross has become the center of Christianity. The symbol is seen not only in churches and cathedrals, but on necklaces, key chains, rings, and pendants.</p>
<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, that an implement of execution should find such common expression. We would surely be appalled to see someone with a small guillotine dangling from an ear lobe, or a gold-plated electric chair on a charm bracelet.</p>
<p>Yet the cross of Jesus has overcome all the negative associations to symbolize instead the meeting of God and man; the fusion of deity and humanity and the blood sacrifice that redeemed us all.</p>
<p>There is no definitive description of what that original cross looked like. Based on archeological evidence, crosses used in crucifixions were rough-hewn planks nailed together where they met. Criminals were often called to drag the crosses, weighing 110 pounds or more, to their execution places.</p>
<p>To make the executions take longer, the Romans nailed a small platform to the foot of the cross where the criminal&rsquo;s feet were nailed. This allowed the victim to push upwards enough to get a breath of air and stave off suffocation.</p>
<p>If we could see the cross of Jesus as it was when He died, its bloodstains would testify to the blood sacrifice made in our behalf. We would still see the holes in the wood where His hands and feet were nailed.</p>
<p>And we could imagine, once again, the power of God descending from heaven into that upright beam and meeting - and redeeming - our sinful nature there: At the cross of Jesus.</p>
<p>Pictured are three types of crosses commonly used by the Roman army in the first century A.D. Each carried an inscription stating the victim&rsquo;s capital offense and a seat-like projection, not designed for the victim&rsquo;s comfort, but to prolong their agony. Nails and ropes held the victim&rsquo;s legs and arms in place. The cross on the left was called a “high tau” cross because it was shaped like the capital Greek letter tau (“T”). The middle cross was known as a “low tau” cross, shaped like the lower case tau (“t”). In both cases the central post was generally set permanently in the ground while the cross bar was carried to the site by the victim. The cross on the right was an actual tree still in the ground (dead or alive) with its limbs serving as the cross bar. Jesus was probably crucified on a “low tau” type cross.</p>
<p><em>For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance; that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. (1 Cor. 15:3-4)</em></p>
