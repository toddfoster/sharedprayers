<p>There’s just one difference. My life was not complete until I crowned it by My <em>death</em> and your walk – your fourteen steps will only be completed until you crown it with your <em>Life.</em></p>

<p>The God who made the universe and holds it in existence, by His will alone, becomes a man, too weak to bear a piece of timber’s weight. How human in His weakness is the Son of Man. My Father willed it thus. I could not be your model otherwise. You too must accept life without complaint of your human frailties.</p>
<h5 id="silence-2">Silence</h5>
<h3 id="i-say-2"><strong>I say:</strong></h3>
<p>Lord Jesus how can I refuse? I willingly accept my weaknesses, my irritations and my moods, my headaches and fatigue, all my defects of body, mind and soul. Because they are Your will for me, these “handicaps” of my humanity I gladly suffer them. Make me content with all my discontents but give me strength to struggle after You.</p>

We hide no pain, no sorrow, from each other’s eyes. This is My Father’s will</p>
<h5 id="silence-3">Silence</h5>
<h3 id="i-say-3"><strong>I say:</strong></h3>
<p>My Jesus, I know what You are telling me. To watch the pain of those we love is harder than to bear our own. To carry my cross after You, I, Too must stand and watch the sufferings of dear ones, the heartaches, sicknesses and grief of those we love.</p>
<p>And I must let them watch mine too. I do believe, for those who love You, all things work together unto good.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-the-stations-of-the-cross">Why do the Stations of the Cross?</h1>
<p>The most important reason for reviving the practice of making the Stations of the Cross is that it is a powerful way to contemplate, and enter into, the mystery of Jesus&rsquo; gift of himself to us. It takes the reflection on the passion out of my head, and makes it an imaginative exercise. It involves my senses, my experience and my emotions. To the extent I come to experience the love of Jesus <em>for me,</em> to that extent the gratitude I feel will be deep. Deep gratitude leads to real generosity and a desire to love as I have been loved. First, just a note about the history of the stations:</p>
<p>The History:</p>
<p>From the earliest of days, followers of Jesus told the story of his passion, death and resurrection. When pilgrims came to see Jerusalem, they were anxious to see the sites where Jesus was. These sites become important holy connections with Jesus. Eventually, following in the footsteps of the Lord, along the way of the cross, became a part of the pilgrimage visit. The stations, as we know them today, came about when it was no longer easy or even possible to visit the holy sites. In the 1500&rsquo;s, villages all over Europe started creating &ldquo;replicas&rdquo; of the way of the cross, with small shrines commemorating the places along the route in Jerusalem. Eventually, these shrines became the set of 14 stations we now know and were placed in almost every Catholic Church in the world.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that this can be as personal as I&rsquo;d like it to be. One of our common religious struggles is to realize that we are not alone. The Good News is that Jesus entered into our life&rsquo;s experience completely - even suffering and death - and that he fell into the hands of a Loving God, who raised him from death to life. We can have complete hope that suffering and death have no complete hold on us. We will all share eternal life with him, if we can fall into the hands of the same Loving God. And, along the way, we are not alone. Jesus is with as one who knows our suffering, and the death we face. That can be deeply consoling.</p>
