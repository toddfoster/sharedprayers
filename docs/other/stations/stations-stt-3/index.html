<p>Lord Jesus Christ my God, I humble myself before your Presence. As I come to accompany you on the way to Calvary, May these stations of the cross remind me of your love and of the price you had to pay for my sins. Let us pray the Way of the Cross with a humble and contrite heart, after all it is because of our sins that Jesus had to die for us.</p>

<h5 id="leader-3">Leader:</h5>
<p>Jesus stands in the most human of places. He has already experienced profound solidarity with so many on this earth, by being beaten and tortured. Now he is wrongfully condemned to punishment by death. His commitment to entering our lives completely begins its final steps. He has said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to God and placed his life in God&rsquo;s hands. We follow him in this final surrender, and contemplate with reverence each place along the way, as he is broken and given for us.</p>

<p><strong>As I view the scene, I become moved by both outrage and gratitude. I look at Jesus. His face. The crown of thorns. The blood. His clothes stuck to the wounds on his back. Pilate washes his hands of the whole affair. Jesus&rsquo; hands are tied behind his back. This is for me. That I might be free. That I might have eternal life. As the journey begins I ask to be with Jesus. To follow his journey. I express my love and thanks.</strong></p>

<h2 id="jesus-carries-his-cross">Jesus carries his cross.</h2>
<h5 id="leader-4">Leader:</h5>
<p>Jesus is made to carry the cross on which he will die. It represents the weight of all our crosses. What he must have felt as he first took it upon his shoulders! With each step he enters more deeply into our human experience. He walks in the path of human misery and suffering, and experiences its crushing weight.</p>

<p><strong>I contemplate the wood of that cross. I imagine how heavy it is. I reflect upon all it means that Jesus is carrying it. I look into his eyes. It&rsquo;s all there. This is for me. So I place myself with him in this Journey. In its anguish. In his freedom and surrender. In the love that must fill his heart. With sorrow and gratitude, I continue the journey. Moved by the power of his love, I am drawn to him and express my love in the words that come to me.</strong></p>

<h5 id="leader-7">Leader:</h5>
<p>The weight is unbearable. Jesus falls under it. How could he enter our lives completely without surrendering to the crushing weight of the life of so many on this earth! He lays on the ground and knows the experience of weakness beneath unfair burdens. He feels the powerlessness of wondering if he will ever be able to continue. He is pulled up and made to continue.</p>

<h5 id="people-4">People:</h5>
<p><strong>I stare at the weakness in his eyes. I can look at his whole body and see the exhaustion. As I behold him there on the ground, being roughly pulled up, I know forever how profoundly he understands my fatigue and my defeats. This is for me. In grief and gratitude I want to let him remain there. As I watch him stand again and gain an inner strength, I accept his love and express my thanks.</strong></p>

<h5 id="leader-8">Leader:</h5>
<p>Jesus&rsquo; path takes him to a powerful source of his strength to continue. All his life, his mother had taught him the meaning of the words, &ldquo;Behold, the handmaid of the Lord.&rdquo; Now they look into each other&rsquo;s eyes. How pierced through her heart must be! How pained he must be to see her tears! Now, her grace-filled smile blesses his mission and stirs his heart to its depth. Love and trust in God bind them together.</p>

<p>##Simon helps Jesus carry his cross.</p>
<h5 id="leader-11">Leader:</h5>
<p>Jesus even experiences our struggle to receive help. He is made to experience the poverty of not being able to carry his burden alone. He enters into the experience of all who must depend upon others to survive. He is deprived of the satisfaction of carrying this burden on his own</p>

<p><strong>I look into his face and contemplate his struggle. His weariness and fragility. His impotence. I see how he looks at Simon, with utmost humility and gratitude. This is for me.

I say what is in my heart, with deep feeling.</strong></p>

<h5 id="leader-12">Leader:</h5>
<p>Jesus&rsquo; journey is at times brutal. He has entered into the terrible experiences of rejection and injustice. He has been whipped and beaten. His face shows the signs of his solidarity with all who have ever suffered injustice and vile, abusive treatment. He encounters a compassionate, loving disciple who wipes the vulgar spit and mocking blood from his face. On her veil, she discovers the image of his face - his gift to her. And, for us to contemplate forever.</p>

<p><strong>What does the face of Jesus hold for me? What do I see, as I look deeply into his face? Can I try to comfort the agony and pain? Can I embrace him, with his face so covered with his passion? The veil I behold is a true icon of his gift of himself. This is for me. In wonder and awe, I behold his face now wiped clean, and see the depth of his suffering in solidarity with all flesh.</strong></p>

<h5 id="leader-15">Leader:</h5>
<p>Even with help, Jesus stumbles and falls to the ground. In deep exhaustion he stares at the earth beneath him. &ldquo;Remember, you are dust and to dust you will return.&rdquo; He has seen death before. Now he can feel the profound weakness of disability and disease and aging itself, there on his knees, under the weight of his cross.</p>

<p><strong>I contemplate Jesus brought very low. As I behold him there on the ground, with all the agony taking its toll on him, I let my heart go out to him.

This is for me, so I express the feelings in my heart.</strong></p>

<p>The women of Jerusalem, and their children, come out to comfort and thank him. They had seen his compassion and welcomed his words of healing and freedom. He had broken all kinds of social and religious conventions to connect with them. Now they are here to support him. He feels their grief. He suffers, knowing he can&rsquo;t remain to help them more in this life. He knows the mystery of facing the separation of death.</p>

<h5 id="leader-19">Leader:</h5>
<p>This last fall is devastating. Jesus can barely proceed to the end. Summoning all this remaining strength, supported by his inner trust in God, Jesus collapses under the weight of the cross. His executioners look at him as a broken man, pathetic yet paying a price he deserves. They help him up so he can make it up the hill of crucifixion.</p>

<p>They take the body of Jesus to its resting place. The huge stone over the tomb is the final sign of the permanence of death. In this final act of surrender, who would have imagined this tomb would soon be empty or that Jesus would show himself alive to his disciples, or that they would recognize him in the breaking of bread? Oh, that our hearts might burn within us, as we realize how he had to suffer and die so as to enter into his glory, for us.</p>

<p><strong>I pause to contemplate this act of closure on his life. In solidarity with all humanity, his body is taken to its grave. I stand for a moment outside this tomb. This final journey of his life has shown me the meaning of his gift of himself for me. This tomb represents every tomb I stand before with fear, in defeat, struggling to believe it could ever be empty. In the fullness of faith in the Risen One, given by his own Holy Spirit, I express my gratitude for this way of the cross. I ask Jesus, whose hands, feet and side still bear the signs of this journey, to grant me the graces I need to take up my cross to be a servant of his own mission.</strong></p>

<h1 id="why-do-the-stations-of-the-cross">Why do the Stations of the Cross?</h1>
<p>The most important reason for reviving the practice of making the Stations of the Cross is that it is a powerful way to contemplate, and enter into, the mystery of Jesus&rsquo; gift of himself to us. It takes the reflection on the passion out of my head, and makes it an imaginative exercise. It involves my senses, my experience and my emotions. To the extent I come to experience the love of Jesus for me, to that extent the gratitude I feel will be deep. Deep gratitude leads to real generosity and a desire to love as I have been loved. First, just a note about the history of the stations:</p>
<p>The History:</p>
<p>From the earliest of days, followers of Jesus told the story of his passion, death and resurrection. When pilgrims came to see Jerusalem, they were anxious to see the sites where Jesus was. These sites become important holy connections with Jesus. Eventually, following in the footsteps of the Lord, along the way of the cross, became a part of the pilgrimage visit. The stations, as we know them today, came about when it was no longer easy or even possible to visit the holy sites. In the 1500&rsquo;s, villages all over Europe started creating &ldquo;replicas&rdquo; of the way of the cross, with small shrines commemorating the places along the route in Jerusalem. Eventually, these shrines became the set of 14 stations we now know and were placed in almost every Catholic Church in the world.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that this can be as personal as I&rsquo;d like it to be. One of our common religious struggles is to realize that we are not alone. The Good News is that Jesus entered into our life&rsquo;s experience completely - even suffering and death - and that he fell into the hands of a Loving God, who raised him from death to life. We can have complete hope that suffering and death have no complete hold on us. We will all share eternal life with him, if we can fall into the hands of the same Loving God. And, along the way, we are not alone. Jesus is with as one who knows our suffering, and the death we face. That can be deeply consoling.</p>
