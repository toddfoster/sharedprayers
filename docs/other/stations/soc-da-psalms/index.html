<p>As soon as morning came, the chief priest with the elders and the scribes … held a council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. Pilate questioned him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He said to him in reply, “You say so.” The chief priests accused him of many things. Again, Pilate questioned him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.” Jesus gave him no further answer. <em>(MK 14: 43-44. 15:1 – 5)</em></p>

<p>(Pilate) said to the Jews, “Behold your king!” They cried out, “Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.” Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and carrying the Cross himself, he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha. <em>(JN 19: 14b-17)</em></p>

<p><strong>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you. Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And about three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice. “Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthane?” Which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Some of the bystanders who hear it said, “This one is calling for Elijah.” Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge; he soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed, gave it to him to drink. But the rest said, “Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him.” But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit. <em>(MT 27:45-50)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I cry aloud to God,<br>
I cry to God to hear me.<br>
<strong>On the day of my distress I seek the Lord’<br>
by night my hands are stretched out unceasingly.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I think of God, I groan’<br>
as I meditate, my spirit grows faint.<br>
<strong>You have kept me from closing my eyes in sleep;<br>
I am troubled and cannot speak.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At night I ponder in my heart;<br>
and as I meditate, my spirit probes:<br>
<strong>“Will the Lord reject us forever,<br>
never again show favor?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Has God’s mercy ceased forever?<br>
Has God forgotten how to show mercy …?<br>
<strong>I conclude: My sorrow is this,<br>
the right hand of the Most High has abandoned us.”</strong><br>

<p><strong>We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you. Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it was evening, since it was the day of preparation, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, a distinguished member of the council, who was himself awaiting the kingdom of God, came and courageously went to Pilate and asked for the Body of Jesus. Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had died. And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the Body to Joseph. <em>(MK 15:42-45)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have rejected and disgraced us ….<br>
You make us retreat before the foe ….<br>
<strong>You hand us over like sheep to be slaughtered ….<br>
You make us the reproach of our neighbors ….</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All this has come upon us,<br>
though we have not forgotten you,<br>
nor been disloyal to your covenant.<br>
<strong>Our hearts have not turned back,<br>
nor have our steps strayed from your path.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have left us crushed,<br>
desolate in a place of jackals;<br>
you have covered us with a shadow of death.<br>
<strong>For you we are slain all the day long,<br>
considered only as sheep to be slaughtered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Awake! Why do you sleep, O LORD?<br>
Why do you hide your face;<br>
why forget our pain and misery?<br>
<strong>Rise up, help us!<br>
Redeem us in your mercy.</strong><br>

<p>Taking the Body (of Jesus), Joseph wrapped it in clean linen and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed. But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained sitting there, facing the tomb. <em>(MT 27:59-61)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LORD, the God of my salvation, I call out by day;<br>
At night I cry aloud in your presence.<br>

I am like a warrior without strength.</strong></p>

your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?<br>

<p>On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed. He said to them, “Don’t be amazed! You seek Jesus the crucified. He has been raised; he is not here.” <em>(MK 16:5-7)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He lifted me out of the slimy pit,<br>
out of the mud and mire;<br>
<strong>he set my feet on a rock<br>
and gave me a firm place to stand.</strong></p>

my body also will rest secure,<br>

you will fill me with joy in your presence,<br>
with eternal pleasures at your right hand.</strong><br>
