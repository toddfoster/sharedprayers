&gt; **Almighty God, our heavenly Father:  
We have sinned against you,  
through our own fault,  
in thought, and word, and deed,  
and in what we have left undone.  
For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,  
forgive us all our offenses;  
and grant that we may serve you  
in newness of life,  
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.**

**Psalm** 91
_Qui habitat_

&gt; 1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, \*  
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.  
&gt; **2	He shall say to the LORD,  
&#34;You are my refuge and my stronghold, \*  
my God in whom I put my trust.&#34;**

&gt; 3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter \*  
and from the deadly pestilence.  
&gt; **4	He shall cover you with his pinions,  
and you shall find refuge under his wings; \*  
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.**

---
&gt; 5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, \*  
nor of the arrow that flies by day;  
&gt; **6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, \*  
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.**

&gt; 7	A thousand shall fall at your side  
and ten thousand at your right hand, \*  
but it shall not come near you.  
&gt; **8	Your eyes have only to behold \*  
to see the reward of the wicked.**

---
&gt; 9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, \*  
and the Most High your habitation,  
&gt; **10	There shall no evil happen to you, \*  
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.**  

&gt; 11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, \*  
to keep you in all your ways.  
&gt; **12	They shall bear you in their hands, \*  
lest you dash your foot against a stone.**

---
&gt; 13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; \*  
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.  
&gt; **14	Because he is bound to me in love,  
therefore will I deliver him; \*  
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.**

&gt; 15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; \*  
I am with him in trouble;  
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.  
&gt; **16	With long life will I satisfy him, \*  
and show him my salvation.**

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
&gt; as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

_Reader_
&gt; May the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
