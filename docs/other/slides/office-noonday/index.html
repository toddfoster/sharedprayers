**Psalm 121**
_Levavi oculos_

&gt; 1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *
from where is my help to come?

&gt; **2	My help comes from the LORD, *
the maker of heaven and earth.**

&gt; 3	He will not let your foot be moved *
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.

&gt; **4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *
shall neither slumber nor sleep;**

&gt; 5	The LORD himself watches over you; *
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,

&gt; **6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *
nor the moon by night.**
