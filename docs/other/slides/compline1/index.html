We have sinned against you,

and in what we have left undone.  
For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,  
forgive us all our offenses;  
and grant that we may serve you  
in newness of life,  
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.**

**Psalm** 4
_Cum invocarem_

&gt; 1	Answer me when I call, O God,  
defender of my cause; \*  
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;  
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.  
&gt; **2	&#34;You mortals,  
	how long will you dishonor my glory; \*  
how long will you worship dumb idols  
and run after false gods?&#34;**  
  
&gt; 3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; \*  
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.  
&gt; **4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; \*  
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.**  
  
---
  
&gt; 5	Offer the appointed sacrifices \*  
and put your trust in the LORD.  
&gt; **6	Many are saying,  
&#34;Oh, that we might see better times!&#34; \*  
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us,  
O LORD.**  
  
&gt; 7	You have put gladness in my heart, \*  
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.  
&gt; **8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; \*  
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.**  

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
&gt; as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**
