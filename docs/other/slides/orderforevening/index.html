&gt; Light and peace, in Jesus Christ our Lord.

**People**
&gt; **Thanks be to God.**

*Officiant*
&gt; Let us pray.

&gt; Almighty God, we give you thanks for surrounding us, as daylight fades, with the brightness of the vesper light; and we implore you of your great mercy that, as you enfold us with the radiance of this light, so you would shine into our hearts the brightness of your Holy Spirit; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

&gt; **O gracious Light, Lord Jesus Christ,
in you the Father&#39;s glory shone,
Immortal, holy, blest is he,
and blest are you, his holy Son.**

&gt; **Now sunset comes, but light shines forth,
the lamps are lit to pierce the night,
Praise Father, Son, and Spirit: God
who dwells in the eternal light.**

&gt; **Worthy are you of endless praise,
O Son of God, Life-giving Lord;
wherefore you are through all the earth
and in the highest heaven adored.**
