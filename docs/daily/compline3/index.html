<p><em>The Officiant begins</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Almighty grant us a peaceful night and a perfect end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our help is in the Name of the Lord;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The maker of heaven and earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant may then say</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us confess our sins to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em> and <strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Almighty God, our heavenly Father:<br>
We have sinned against you,<br>
through our own fault,<br>
in thought, and word, and deed,<br>
and in what we have left undone.<br>
For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
forgive us all our offenses;<br>
and grant that we may serve you<br>
in newness of life,<br>
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May the Almighty God grant us forgiveness of all our sins, and the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>People</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant then says</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, make speed to save us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O Lord, make haste to help us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em> and <strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:  as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Lent, add</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alleluia.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 9</p>
<p><em>Confitebor tibi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *<br>
I will tell of all your marvelous works.<br>
<strong>2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; *<br>
I will sing to your Name, O Most High.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	When my enemies are driven back, *<br>
they will stumble and perish at your presence.<br>
<strong>4	For you have maintained my right and my cause; *<br>
you sit upon your throne judging right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *<br>
you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.<br>
<strong>6	As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *<br>
their cities plowed under, the memory of them perished;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	But the LORD is enthroned for ever; *<br>
he has set up his throne for judgment.<br>
<strong>8	It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *<br>
he judges the peoples with equity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, *<br>
a refuge in time of trouble.<br>
<strong>10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *<br>
for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; *<br>
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.<br>
<strong>12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; *<br>
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Have pity on me, O LORD; *<br>
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,<br>
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;<br>
<strong>14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation *<br>
in the gates of the city of Zion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *<br>
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.<br>
<strong>16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; *<br>
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *<br>
and also all the people that forget God.<br>
<strong>18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *<br>
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *<br>
let them be judged before you.<br>
<strong>20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; *<br>
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A lesson is read</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, and great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.  <em>Hebrews 13:20-21</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A hymn suitable for the evening may be sung.</em></p>
<p><em>Then follows</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V.  Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit;<br>
<strong>R.  For you have redeemed me, O Lord, O God of truth.</strong><br>
V.  Keep us, O Lord, as the apple of your eye;<br>
<strong>R.  Hide us under the shadow of your wings.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officiant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Christ have mercy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officiant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Officiant and People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Father in heaven,<br>
<strong>hallowed be your Name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
on earth as in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
Forgive us our sins<br>
as we forgive those<br>
who sin against us.<br>
Save us from the time of trial,<br>
and deliver us from evil.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, hear our prayer;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>And let our cry come to you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant then says one of the following Collects</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look down, O Lord, from your heavenly throne, and illumine this night with your celestial brightness; that by night as by day your people may glorify your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or<br>
weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who<br>
sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless<br>
the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the<br>
joyous; and all for your love&rsquo;s sake.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Silence may be kept, and free intercessions and thanksgivings may be offered.</em></p>
<p><em>The service concludes with the Song of Simeon with this Antiphon, which is sung or said by all</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guide us waking, O Lord, and guard us sleeping; that awake we may watch with Christ, and asleep we may rest in peace.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In Easter Season, add</em> <strong>Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guide us waking, O Lord, and guard us sleeping;<br>
that awake we may watch with Christ, and asleep we may rest in peace.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In Easter Season, add</em>  <strong>Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</strong></p>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us bless the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant concludes</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The almighty and merciful Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, bless us and keep us.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
