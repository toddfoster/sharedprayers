<blockquote>
<p>O God, make speed to save us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O Lord, make haste to help us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant and <strong>People</strong></em><br>
<strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<p><em>Except in Lent, add</em>  <strong>Alleluia.</strong></p>
<p><em>A suitable hymn may be sung.</em></p>
<p><em>One or more of the following Psalms is sung or said.  Other suitable selections include Psalms 19,67, one or more sections of Psalm 119, or a selection from Psalms 120 through 133.</em></p>
<h3 id="psalm-119">Psalm 119</h3>
<p><em>Lucerna pedibus meis</em></p>
<p>105  Your word is a lantern to my feet *<br>
and a light upon my path.<br>
<strong>106  I have sworn and am determined *<br>
to keep your righteous judgments.</strong></p>
<p>107  I am deeply troubled; *<br>
preserve my life, O Lord, according to your word.<br>
<strong>108  Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *<br>
and teach me your judgments.</strong></p>
<p>109  My life is always in my hand, *<br>
yet I do not forget your law.<br>
<strong>110  The wicked have set a trap for me, *<br>
but I have not strayed from your commandments.</strong></p>
<p>111  Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *<br>
truly, they are the joy of my heart.<br>
<strong>112  I have applied my heart to fulfill your statues *<br>
for ever and to the end.</strong></p>
<h3 id="psalm-121">Psalm 121</h3>
<p><em>Levavi oculos</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *<br>
from where is my help to come?<br>
<strong>2	My help comes from the LORD, *<br>
the maker of heaven and earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He will not let your foot be moved *<br>
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.<br>
<strong>4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *<br>
shall neither slumber nor sleep;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	The LORD himself watches over you; *<br>
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,<br>
<strong>6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *<br>
nor the moon by night.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; *<br>
it is he who shall keep you safe.<br>
<strong>8	The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *<br>
from this time forth for evermore.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="psalm-126">Psalm 126</h3>
<p><em>In convertendo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *<br>
then were we like those who dream.<br>
<strong>2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *<br>
and our tongue with shouts of joy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Then they said among the nations, *<br>
&ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	The LORD has done great things for us, *<br>
and we are glad indeed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *<br>
like the watercourses of the Negev.<br>
<strong>6	Those who sowed with tears *<br>
will reap with songs of joy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *<br>
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>At the end of the Psalms is sung or said</em></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<p><em>One of the following, or some other suitable passage of Scripture, is read</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.  <em>Romans 5:5</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks be to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or the following</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone is in Christ he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold the new has come.  All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.  <em>2 Corinthians 5:17-18</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks be to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or this</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the rising of the sun to its setting my Name shall be great among the nations, and in every place incense shall be offered to my Name, and a pure offering; for my Name shall be great among the nations, says the Lord of Hosts.  <em>Malachi 1:11</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks be to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A meditation, silent or spoken, may follow.</em></p>

<p>Our Father in heaven,<br>
<strong>hallowed be your Name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
on earth as in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
Forgive us our sins<br>
as we forgive those<br>
who sin against us.<br>

<p><em>The Officiant then says one of the following Collects.  If desired, the Collect of the Day may be used.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heavenly Father, send your Holy Spirit into our hearts, to direct and rule us according to your will, to comfort us in all our afflictions, to defend us from all error, and to lead us into all truth; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed Savior, at this hour you hung upon the cross, stretching out your loving arms:  Grant that all the peoples of the earth may look to you and be saved;  for your tender mercies&rsquo; sake.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almighty Savior, who at noonday called your servant Saint Paul to be an apostle to the Gentiles:  We pray you to illumine the world with the radiance of your glory, that all nations may come and worship you; for you live and reign for ever and ever.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, &ldquo;Peace I give to you; my peace I leave with you:&rdquo; Regard not our sins, but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and unity of that heavenly city, where with the Father and the Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
