<strong>All:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *<br>
call upon him when he draws near.<br>
Let the wicked forsake their ways *<br>
and the evil ones their thoughts;<br>
And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *<br>
and to our God, for he will richly pardon.<br>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *<br>
nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.<br>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *<br>
so are my ways higher than your ways,<br>
and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *<br>
and return not again, but water the earth,<br>
Bringing forth life and giving growth, *<br>
seed for sowing and bread for eating,<br>
So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *<br>
it will not return to me empty;<br>
But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *<br>
and prosper in that for which I sent it.</strong></p>

The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.<br>
Violence will no more be heard in your land, *<br>

by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.<br>
The Lord will be your everlasting light, * and your God will be your glory.</strong></p>
