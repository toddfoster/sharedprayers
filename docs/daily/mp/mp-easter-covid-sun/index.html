<p>This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.</p>
<p>On Saturday nights of Sundays, if this service is taking the place of a Eucharist, one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary, which can be conveniently found at <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>.</p>
<p>Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/">oremus Bible Browser</a>.</p>
<p>For the first collect, &ldquo;Proper to the Day&rdquo; (after the Suffrages), one may again use <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>, the collect for the current (on weekdays, the preceding) Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *<br>
the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.<br>
The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *<br>
the Lord has become my Savior.<br>
This is my God and I will praise him, *<br>
the God of my people and I will exalt him.<br>
The Lord is a mighty warrior; *<br>
Yahweh is his Name.<br>
The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; *<br>
the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.<br>
The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *<br>
they sank into the depths like a stone.<br>
Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *<br>
your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.<br>
Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *<br>
who is like you, glorious in holiness,<br>
awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?<br>
You stretched forth your right hand; *<br>
the earth swallowed them up.<br>
With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *<br>
with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.<br>
You will bring them in and plant them *<br>
on the mount of your possession,<br>
The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, *<br>
the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.<br>
The Lord shall reign *<br>
for ever and for ever.</strong></p>
