<p><strong>Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *<br>
death no longer has dominion over him.<br>
The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *<br>

So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *<br>
and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ has been raised from the dead, *<br>
the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br>
For since by a man came death, *<br>
by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.<br>
For as in Adam all die, *<br>
so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</strong></p>
