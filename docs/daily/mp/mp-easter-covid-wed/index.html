For behold, darkness covers the land; *<br>

and his glory will appear upon you.<br>
Nations Will stream to your light, *<br>
and kings to the brightness of your dawning.<br>
Your gates will always be open; *<br>
by day or night they will never be shut.<br>
They will call you, The City of the Lord, *<br>
The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.<br>
Violence will no more be heard in your land, *<br>
ruin or destruction within your borders.<br>
You will call your walls, Salvation, *<br>
and all your portals, Praise.<br>
The sun will no more be your light by day; *<br>
by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.<br>
The Lord will be your everlasting light, * and your God will be your glory.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
