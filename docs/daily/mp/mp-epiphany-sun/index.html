<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
