<p>This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.</p>
<p>On Saturday nights of Sundays, if this service is taking the place of a Eucharist, one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary, which can be conveniently found at <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>.</p>
<p>Lessons for the daily office during the Christmas season (12 days) can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 940f.</p>
<p>You will note that lessons are not provided on those pages for 26, 27, and 28 December. Those are feast days for St. Stephen, St. John, and the Holy Innocents, respectively. Their readings can be found in the BCP on page 996. To make things a little more confusing, if any of these three feasts occur on a Sunday, they are transferred to the nearest subsequent weekday. For example, in 2021, 26 December is a Sunday. So the feast of St. Stephen is transferred to 27 Dec, the feast of St. John to 28 Dec, and the feast of the Holy Innocents to 29 December. (Calendars will disagree among themselves about this.)</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/">oremus Bible Browser</a>.</p>
<p>For the first collect, &ldquo;Proper to the Day&rdquo; (after the Suffrages), one may again use <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>, the collect for the current (on weekdays, the preceding) Sunday. In the BCP, Contemporary-language Collects are found on pp. 211ff. Collects for the three feasts following Christmas Day may be found on BCP pp. 237f.</p>

<p><strong>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *<br>
call upon him when he draws near.<br>
Let the wicked forsake their ways *<br>
and the evil ones their thoughts;<br>
And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *<br>

nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.<br>
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *<br>
so are my ways higher than your ways,<br>
and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *<br>
and return not again, but water the earth,<br>
Bringing forth life and giving growth, *<br>
seed for sowing and bread for eating,<br>
So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *<br>
it will not return to me empty;<br>
But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *<br>
and prosper in that for which I sent it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>

He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>

Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p><em>A Prayer for Mission</em><br>
Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
