For since by a man came death, *<br>
by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.<br>
For as in Adam all die, *<br>
so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *<br>
the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.<br>
The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *<br>

The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; *<br>
the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.<br>
The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *<br>
they sank into the depths like a stone.<br>
Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *<br>
your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.<br>
Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *<br>
who is like you, glorious in holiness,<br>

You stretched forth your right hand; *<br>
the earth swallowed them up.<br>
With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *<br>
with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.<br>
You will bring them in and plant them *<br>

<p><strong>You, Christ, are the king of glory,<br>

When you became man to set us free<br>
you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.<br>
You overcame the sting of death<br>

You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.<br>
We believe that you will come and be our judge.<br>
Come then, Lord, and help your people,<br>
bought with the price of your own blood,<br>
and bring us with your saints<br>
