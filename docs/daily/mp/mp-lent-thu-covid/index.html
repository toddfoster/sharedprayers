<p>This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff. If you don&rsquo;t have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/">oremus Bible Browser</a>. On Sundays one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary instead, which can be conveniently found at <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>.</p>
<p>One also may wish to find, again from <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>, the collect for the previous Sunday to use as the first of the collects (after the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer).</p>

who is like you, glorious in holiness,<br>
awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?<br>
You stretched forth your right hand; *<br>
the earth swallowed them up.<br>
With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *<br>
with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.<br>
You will bring them in and plant them *<br>
