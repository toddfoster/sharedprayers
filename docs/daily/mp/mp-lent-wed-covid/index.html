<p><strong>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, *<br>
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br>
and of all their righteous offspring:<br>
You made the heavens and the earth, *<br>
with all their vast array.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All things quake with fear at your presence; *<br>
they tremble because of your power.<br>
But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; *<br>
it surpasses all that our minds can fathom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>O Lord, you are full of compassion, *<br>
long-suffering, and abounding in mercy.<br>
You hold back your hand; *<br>
you do not punish as we deserve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your great goodness, Lord,<br>
you have promised forgiveness to sinners, *<br>
that they may repent of their sin and be saved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, *<br>
and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness.<br>
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, *<br>
and I know my wickedness only too well.<br>
Therefore I make this prayer to you: *<br>
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.<br>
Do not let me perish in my sin, *<br>
nor condemn me to the depths of the earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, *<br>
and in me you will show forth your goodness.<br>
Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br>
in accordance with your great mercy, *<br>
and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life.<br>
For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, *<br>
and yours is the glory to ages of ages. Amen.</strong></p>
