<p>This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff. If you don&rsquo;t have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/">oremus Bible Browser</a>.

<p>One also may wish to find, again from <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>, the collect for the previous Sunday to use as the first of the collects (after the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer).</p>

Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *<br>

Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *<br>

Therefore I make this prayer to you: *<br>
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.<br>
Do not let me perish in my sin, *<br>

Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br>

For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, *<br>
and yours is the glory to ages of ages. Amen.</strong></p>
