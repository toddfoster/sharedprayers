<h5 id="all-1"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Come, let us sing to the LORD; *<br>
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.<br>
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *<br>
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the LORD is a great God, *<br>
and a great King above all gods.<br>
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *<br>
and the heights of the hills are his also.<br>
The sea is his, for he made it, *<br>
and his hands have molded the dry land.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *<br>
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.<br>
For he is our God,<br>
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *<br>
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Harden not your hearts,<br>
as your forebears did in the wilderness, *<br>
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,<br>
when they tempted me.<br>
They put me to the test, *<br>
though they had seen my works.<br>
Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *<br>
&ldquo;This people are wayward in their hearts;<br>
they do not know my ways.&rdquo;<br>
So I swore in my wrath, *<br>
&ldquo;They shall not enter into my rest.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, *<br>
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br>
and of all their righteous offspring:<br>
You made the heavens and the earth, *<br>
with all their vast array.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All things quake with fear at your presence; *<br>
they tremble because of your power.<br>
But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; *<br>
it surpasses all that our minds can fathom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>O Lord, you are full of compassion, *<br>
long-suffering, and abounding in mercy.<br>
You hold back your hand; *<br>
you do not punish as we deserve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your great goodness, Lord,<br>
you have promised forgiveness to sinners, *<br>
that they may repent of their sin and be saved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, *<br>
and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness.<br>
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, *<br>
and I know my wickedness only too well.<br>
Therefore I make this prayer to you: *<br>
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.<br>
Do not let me perish in my sin, *<br>
nor condemn me to the depths of the earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, *<br>
and in me you will show forth your goodness.<br>
Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br>
in accordance with your great mercy, *<br>
and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life.<br>
For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, *<br>
and yours is the glory to ages of ages. Amen.</strong></p>
