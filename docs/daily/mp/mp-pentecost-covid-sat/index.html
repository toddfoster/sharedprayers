<p>Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/">oremus Bible Browser</a>.</p>
<p>For the first collect, &ldquo;Proper to the Day&rdquo; (after the Suffrages), one may again use <a href="https://lectionarypage.net">lectionarypage.net</a>, the collect for the current (on weekdays, the preceding) Sunday.</p>
