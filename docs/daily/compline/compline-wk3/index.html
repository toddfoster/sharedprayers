<blockquote>
<p>1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *<br>
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
<strong>2	He shall say to the LORD,<br>
&ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *<br>
my God in whom I put my trust.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *<br>
and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
<strong>4	He shall cover you with his pinions,<br>
and you shall find refuge under his wings; *<br>
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *<br>
nor of the arrow that flies by day;<br>
<strong>6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, *<br>
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	A thousand shall fall at your side<br>
and ten thousand at your right hand, *<br>
but it shall not come near you.<br>
<strong>8	Your eyes have only to behold *<br>
to see the reward of the wicked.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *<br>
and the Most High your habitation,<br>
<strong>10	There shall no evil happen to you, *<br>
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, *<br>
to keep you in all your ways.<br>
<strong>12	They shall bear you in their hands, *<br>
lest you dash your foot against a stone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *<br>
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.<br>
<strong>14	Because he is bound to me in love,<br>
therefore will I deliver him; *<br>
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *<br>
I am with him in trouble;<br>
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.<br>
<strong>16	With long life will I satisfy him, *<br>
and show him my salvation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
