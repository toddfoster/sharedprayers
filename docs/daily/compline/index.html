<p><em>The Officiant begins</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Almighty grant us a peaceful night and a perfect end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our help is in the Name of the Lord;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The maker of heaven and earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant may then say</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us confess our sins to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em> and <strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Almighty God, our heavenly Father:<br>
We have sinned against you,<br>
through our own fault,<br>
in thought, and word, and deed,<br>
and in what we have left undone.<br>
For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
forgive us all our offenses;<br>
and grant that we may serve you<br>
in newness of life,<br>
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May the Almighty God grant us forgiveness of all our sins, and the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>People</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant then says</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, make speed to save us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O Lord, make haste to help us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em> and <strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:  as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Except in Lent, add</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alleluia.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>One or more of the following Psalms are sung or said.  Other suitable selections may be substituted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 4</p>
<p><em>Cum invocarem</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *<br>
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;<br>
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.<br>
<strong>2	&ldquo;You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *<br>
how long will you worship dumb idols<br>
and run after false gods?&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *<br>
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.<br>
<strong>4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; *<br>
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Offer the appointed sacrifices *<br>
and put your trust in the LORD.<br>
<strong>6	Many are saying,<br>
&ldquo;Oh, that we might see better times!&rdquo; *<br>
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You have put gladness in my heart, *<br>
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.<br>
<strong>8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *<br>
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 8</p>
<p><em>Domine, Dominus noster</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	O LORD our Governor, *<br>
how exalted is your Name in all the world!<br>
<strong>2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *<br>
your majesty is praised above the heavens.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *<br>
to quell the enemy and the avenger.<br>
<strong>4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *<br>
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *<br>
the son of man that you should seek him out?<br>
<strong>6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *<br>
you adorn him with glory and honor;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *<br>
you put all things under his feet:<br>
<strong>8	All sheep and oxen, *<br>
even the wild beasts of the field,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *<br>
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.<br>
<strong>10	O LORD our Governor, *<br>
how exalted is your Name in all the world!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 9</p>
<p><em>Confitebor tibi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *<br>
I will tell of all your marvelous works.<br>
<strong>2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; *<br>
I will sing to your Name, O Most High.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	When my enemies are driven back, *<br>
they will stumble and perish at your presence.<br>
<strong>4	For you have maintained my right and my cause; *<br>
you sit upon your throne judging right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You have rebuked the ungodly and destroyed the wicked; *<br>
you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.<br>
<strong>6	As for the enemy, they are finished, in perpetual ruin, *<br>
their cities plowed under, the memory of them perished;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	But the LORD is enthroned for ever; *<br>
he has set up this throne for judgment.<br>
<strong>8	It is he who rules the world with righteousness; *<br>
he judges the peoples with equity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The LORD will be a refuge for the oppressed, *<br>
a refuge in time of trouble.<br>
<strong>10	Those who know your Name will put their trust in you, *<br>
for you never forsake those who seek you, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Sing praise to the LORD who dwells in Zion; *<br>
proclaim to the peoples the things he has done.<br>
<strong>12	The Avenger of blood will remember them; *<br>
he will not forget the cry of the afflicted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Have pity on me, O LORD; *<br>
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,<br>
O you who lift me up from the gate of death;<br>
<strong>14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your salvation *<br>
in the gates of the city of Zion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	The ungodly have fallen into the pit they dug, *<br>
and in the snare they set is their own foot caught.<br>
<strong>16	The LORD is known by his acts of justice; *<br>
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own hands.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	The wicked shall be given over to the grave, *<br>
and also all the people that forget God.<br>
<strong>18	For the needy shall not always be forgotten, *<br>
and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the upper hand; *<br>
let them be judged before you.<br>
<strong>20	Put fear upon them, O LORD; *<br>
let the ungodly know they are but mortal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 134</p>
<p><em>Ecce nunc</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Behold now, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, *<br>
you that stand by night in the house of the LORD.<br>
<strong>2	Lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the LORD; *<br>
the LORD who made heaven and earth bless you out of Zion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>At the end of the Psalms is sung or said</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>One of the following, or some other suitable passage of Scripture, is read</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, you are in the midst of us, and we are called by your Name:  Do not forsake us, O Lord our God.  <em>Jeremiah 14:9,22</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or this</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <em>Matthew 11:28-30</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or the following</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, and great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.  <em>Hebrews 13:20-21</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or this</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sober, be watchful.  Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith.  <em>1 Peter 5:8-9a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A hymn suitable for the evening may be sung.</em></p>
<p><em>Then follows</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>V.  Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit;<br>
<strong>R.  For you have redeemed me, O Lord, O God of truth.</strong><br>
V.  Keep us, O Lord, as the apple of your eye;<br>
<strong>R.  Hide us under the shadow of your wings.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officiant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Christ have mercy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officiant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant and <strong>People</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Father in heaven,<br>
hallowed be your Name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
on earth as in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
Forgive us our sins<br>
as we forgive those<br>
who sin against us.<br>
Save us from the time of trial,<br>
and deliver us from evil.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, hear our prayer;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>And let our cry come to you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Officiant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Officiant then says one of the following Collects</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be our light in the darkness, O Lord, and in your great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the love of your only Son, our Savior Jesus Christ.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be present, O merciful God, and protect us through the hours of this night, so that we who are wearied by the changes and chances of this life may rest in your eternal changelessness; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Look down, O Lord, from your heavenly throne, and illumine this night with your celestial brightness; that by night as by day your people may glorify your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Visit this place, O Lord, and drive far from it all snare of the enemy; let your holy angels dwell with us to preserve us in peace; and let your blessing be upon us always; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Collect for Saturdays</em><br>
We give thanks, O God, for revealing your Son Jesus Christ to us by the light of his resurrection:  Grant that as we sing your glory at the close of this day, our joy may abound in the morning as we celebrate the Paschal mystery; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>One of the following prayers may be added</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or<br>
weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who<br>
sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless<br>
the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the<br>
joyous; and all for your love&rsquo;s sake.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>or this</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, your unfailing providence sustains the world we live<br>
in and the life we live:  Watch over those, both night and day,<br>
who work while others sleep, and grant that we may never<br>
forget that our common life depends upon each other&rsquo;s toil;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Silence may be kept, and free intercessions and thanksgivings may be offered.</em></p>
<p><em>The service concludes with the Song of Simeon with this Antiphon, which is sung or said by all</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guide us waking, O Lord, and guard us sleeping; that awake we may watch with Christ, and asleep we may rest in peace.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In Easter Season, add</em> <strong>Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</strong></p>
