&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all things in your well-beloved Son, the King of kings and Lord of lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided and enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together under his most gracious rule; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the last words of David:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oracle of David, son of Jesse, the oracle of the man whom God exalted,&lt;br&gt;
the anointed of the God of Jacob, the favorite of the Strong One of Israel:&lt;br&gt;
The spirit of the LORD speaks through me, his word is upon my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
The God of Israel has spoken, the Rock of Israel has said to me:&lt;br&gt;
One who rules over people justly, ruling in the fear of God,&lt;br&gt;
is like the light of morning, like the sun rising on a cloudless morning, gleaming from the rain on the grassy land.&lt;br&gt;
Is not my house like this with God? For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure.&lt;br&gt;
Will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?&lt;br&gt;
But the godless are all like thorns that are thrown away; for they cannot be picked up with the hand;&lt;br&gt;
to touch them one uses an iron bar or the shaft of a spear. And they are entirely consumed in fire on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1321-1314-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 132:1-13,(14-19)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memento, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, remember / David, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the hardships he en- / dured;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	How he swore an oath to the / LORD *&lt;br&gt;
and vowed a vow to the Mighty One of / Jacob:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	&amp;ldquo;I will not come under the roof of my / house, *&lt;br&gt;
nor climb up into my / bed;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I will not allow my eyes to / sleep, *&lt;br&gt;
nor let my eyelids / slumber;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Until I find a place for the / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
a dwelling for the Mighty One of / Jacob.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	&amp;ldquo;The ark! We heard it was in / Ephratah; *&lt;br&gt;
we found it in the fields of / Jearim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Let us go to God&amp;rsquo;s / dwelling place; *&lt;br&gt;
let us fall upon our knees before his / footstool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Arise, O LORD, into your / resting-place, *&lt;br&gt;
you and the ark of your / strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Let your priests be clothed with / righteousness; *&lt;br&gt;
let your faithful people sing with / joy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For your servant David&amp;rsquo;s / sake, *&lt;br&gt;
do not turn away the face of your A- / nointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	The LORD has sworn an oath to / David; *&lt;br&gt;
in truth, he will not / break it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	&amp;ldquo;A son, the fruit of your / body *&lt;br&gt;
will I set upon your / throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	If your children keep my covenant&lt;br&gt;
and my testimonies that I shall / teach them, *&lt;br&gt;
their children will sit upon your throne for ever- / more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For the LORD has chosen / Zion; *&lt;br&gt;
he has desired her for his habi- / tation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	&amp;ldquo;This shall be my resting-place for / ever; *&lt;br&gt;
here will I dwell, for I delight in / her.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	I will surely bless her pro- / visions, *&lt;br&gt;
and satisfy her poor with / bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	I will clothe her priests with sal- / vation, *&lt;br&gt;
and her faithful people will rejoice and / sing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	There will I make the horn of David / flourish; *&lt;br&gt;
I have prepared a lamp for my A- / nointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;last-half-of-tone&#34;&gt;Last half of tone:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	As for his enemies, I will clothe them with / shame; *&lt;br&gt;
but as for him, his crown will / shine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_revelation-14b-8_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Revelation 1:4b-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood, and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him,&lt;br&gt;
even those who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes of the earth will wail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is to be. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?” Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?” Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.” Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_1-samuel-14-20_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Samuel 1:4-20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters; but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb. Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the LORD. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly. She made this vow: “O LORD of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk. So Eli said to her, “How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.” But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD. Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.” Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.” And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-samuel-21-10&#34;&gt;1 Samuel 2:1-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah prayed and said,&lt;br&gt;
“My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in my God.&lt;br&gt;
There is no Holy One like the LORD, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.&lt;br&gt;
Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.&lt;br&gt;
The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.&lt;br&gt;
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.&lt;br&gt;
The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.&lt;br&gt;
He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap,&lt;br&gt;
to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor.&lt;br&gt;
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD&amp;rsquo;s, and on them he has set the world.&lt;br&gt;
He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-1011-1415-1819-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 10:11-14,(15-18),19-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every priest stands day after day at his service, offering again and again the same sacrifices that can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, “he sat down at the right hand of God,” and since then has been waiting “until his enemies would be made a footstool for his feet.” For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. [And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he also adds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!” Then Jesus asked him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?” Then Jesus began to say to them, “Beware that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birthpangs.”&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We thank you that in the Bible we can learn about Jesus, our Savior and Friend.

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi her mother-in-law said to Ruth, “My daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you. Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.” She said to her, “All that you tell me I will do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When they came together, the LORD made her conceive, and she bore a son. Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without next-of-kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel! He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him.” Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse. The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed; he became the father of Jesse, the father of David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, a mere copy of the true one, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Holy Place year after year with blood that is not his own; for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for mortals to die once, and after that the judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus taught, he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets! They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which are worth a penny. Then he called his disciples and said to them, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Wisdom of Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, 				and no torment will ever touch them. 				In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, 				and their departure was thought to be a disaster, 				and their going from us to be their destruction; 				but they are at peace. 				For though in the sight of others they were punished, 				their hope is full of immortality. 				Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, 				because God tested them and found them worthy of himself; 				like gold in the furnace he tried them, 				and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them. 				In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, 				and will run like sparks through the stubble. 				They will govern nations and rule over peoples, 				and the Lord will reign over them forever. 				Those who trust in him will understand truth, 				and the faithful will abide with him in love, 				because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones, 			and he watches over his elect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. 				He will dwell with them as their God; 				they will be his peoples, 				and God himself will be with them; 				he will wipe every tear from their eyes. 				Death will be no more; 				mourning and crying and pain will be no more, 					for the first things have passed away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the one who was seated on the throne said, &amp;ldquo;See, I am making all things new.&amp;rdquo; Also he said, &amp;ldquo;Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&amp;rdquo; When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. He said, &amp;ldquo;Where have you laid him?&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, come and see.&amp;rdquo; Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, &amp;ldquo;See how he loved him!&amp;rdquo; But some of them said, &amp;ldquo;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Take away the stone.&amp;rdquo; Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?&amp;rdquo; So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, &amp;ldquo;Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&amp;rdquo; The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.&lt;br&gt;
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;br&gt;
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember [&lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt;] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and two sons. The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years, both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD had considered his people and given them food. So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah. But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &amp;ldquo;Go back each of you to your mother&amp;rsquo;s house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. The LORD grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your husband.&amp;rdquo; Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;No, we will return with you to your people.&amp;rdquo; But Naomi said, &amp;ldquo;Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight and bear sons, would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the LORD has turned against me.&amp;rdquo; Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she said, &amp;ldquo;See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” But Ruth said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you!&lt;br&gt;
Where you go, I will go; Where you lodge, I will lodge;&lt;br&gt;
your people shall be my people, and your God my God.&lt;br&gt;
Where you die, I will die— there will I be buried.&lt;br&gt;
May the Lord do thus and so to me, and more as well,&lt;br&gt;
if even death parts me from you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.&lt;/p&gt;

the LORD cares for the / stranger; *&lt;br&gt;
he sustains the orphan and widow,&lt;br&gt;
but frustrates the way of the / wicked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the scribes came near and heard the Saducees disputing with one another, and seeing that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?” Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” Then the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that ‘he is one, and besides him there is no other’; and ‘to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,’ and ‘to love one’s neighbor as oneself,’ —this is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that no one dared to ask him any question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job answered the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.&lt;br&gt;
‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.&lt;br&gt;
‘Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to me.’&lt;br&gt;
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring. The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. After this Job lived for one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations. And Job died, old and full of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-341-819-22&#34;&gt;Psalm 34:1-8,(19-22)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedicam Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will bless the LORD at all / times; *&lt;br&gt;
his praise shall ever be in my / mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	I will glory in the / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let the humble hear and re- / joice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Proclaim with me the greatness of the / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us exalt his Name to- / gether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I sought the LORD, and he / answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and delivered me out of all my / terror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Look upon him and be / radiant, *&lt;br&gt;
and let not your faces be a- / shamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I called in my affliction and the LORD / heard me *&lt;br&gt;
and saved me from all my / troubles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The angel of the LORD encompasses those who / fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will de- / liver them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Taste and see that the LORD is / good; *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who trust in / him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Many are the troubles of the / righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the LORD will deliver him out of them / all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He will keep safe all his / bones; *&lt;br&gt;
not one of them shall be / broken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Evil shall slay the / wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
and those who hate the righteous will be / punished.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	The LORD ransoms the life of his / servants, *&lt;br&gt;
and none will be punished who trust in / him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-723-28_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 7:23-28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but Jesus holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Jesus stood still and said, “Call him here.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; get up, he is calling you.” So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “My teacher, let me see again.” Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, in Christ you have revealed your glory among the nations: Preserve the works of your mercy, that your Church throughout the world may persevere with steadfast faith in the confession of your Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?&lt;br&gt;
Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.&lt;br&gt;
Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?&lt;br&gt;
On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone&lt;br&gt;
when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?&lt;br&gt;
[“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that a flood of waters may cover you?&lt;br&gt;
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go and say to you, ‘Here we are’?&lt;br&gt;
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?&lt;br&gt;
Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,&lt;br&gt;
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods cling together?&lt;br&gt;
“Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,&lt;br&gt;
when they crouch in their dens, or lie in wait in their covert?&lt;br&gt;
Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-51-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 5:1-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness; and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are my Son, today I have begotten you”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as he says also in another place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?” And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. &lt;em&gt;Amos 5:8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now as we come to the setting of the sun,&lt;br&gt;
and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You have set the earth upon its foun- / dations, *&lt;br&gt;
so that it never shall move at any / time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You covered it with the Deep as with a / mantle; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	At your rebuke they / fled; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?&lt;br&gt;
Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.&lt;br&gt;
Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?&lt;br&gt;
On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone&lt;br&gt;
when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?&lt;br&gt;
[“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that a flood of waters may cover you?&lt;br&gt;
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go and say to you, ‘Here we are’?&lt;br&gt;
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?&lt;br&gt;
Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,&lt;br&gt;
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods cling together?&lt;br&gt;
“Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,&lt;br&gt;
when they crouch in their dens, or lie in wait in their covert?&lt;br&gt;
Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-51-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 5:1-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness; and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are my Son, today I have begotten you”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as he says also in another place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bcp-120&#34;&gt;BCP 120&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-third-lesson-_mark-1035-45_&#34;&gt;The Third Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Mark 10:35-45&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Mark’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?” And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”&lt;/p&gt;

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;

and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today also my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his dwelling!&lt;br&gt;
I would lay my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.&lt;br&gt;
I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.&lt;br&gt;
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.&lt;br&gt;
There an upright person could reason with him, and I should be acquitted forever by my judge.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him;&lt;br&gt;
on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him; I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.&lt;br&gt;
God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;&lt;br&gt;
If only I could vanish in darkness, and thick darkness would cover my face!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-221-15&#34;&gt;Psalm 22:1-15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you for- / saken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my dis- / tress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not / answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no / rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the / Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of / Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in / you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered / them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were de- / livered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to / shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no / man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the / people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to / scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, / saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him de- / liver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in / him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the / womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s / breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was / born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s / womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is / near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to / help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls en- / circle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan sur- / round me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their / jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring / lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of / joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting / wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;last-half-of-tone&#34;&gt;Last half of tone:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my / mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the / grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-412-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 4:12-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.’” He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.” Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” They were greatly astounded and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.” Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”&lt;/p&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord. The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” The Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.” Then Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives. But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.” The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then his wife said to him, “Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die.” But he said to her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not receive the bad?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-11-4-25-12_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 1:1-4; 2:5-12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels. But someone has testified somewhere,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them?&lt;br&gt;
You have made them for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned them with glory and honor, subjecting all things under their feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them, but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters, in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Pharisees came, and to test Jesus they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.” But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.” And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Esther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. On the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.” Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have won your favor, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me&amp;ndash; that is my petition&amp;ndash; and the lives of my people&amp;ndash; that is my request. For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; but no enemy can compensate for this damage to the king.” Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who has presumed to do this?” Esther said, “A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman!” Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Look, the very gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, stands at Haman&amp;rsquo;s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on that.” So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the anger of the king abated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mordecai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same month, year by year, as the days on which the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and presents to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-124&#34;&gt;Psalm 124&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nisi quia Dominus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	If the LORD had not been on our / side, *&lt;br&gt;
let Israel now / say;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	If the LORD had not been on our / side, *&lt;br&gt;
when enemies rose up a- / gainst us;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then would they have swallowed us up a- / live *&lt;br&gt;
in their fierce anger to- / ward us;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Then would the waters have over- / whelmed us *&lt;br&gt;
and the torrent gone / over us;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then would the raging / waters *&lt;br&gt;
have gone right / over us.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Blessed be the / LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
he has not given us over to be a prey for their / teeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the / fowler; *&lt;br&gt;
the snare is broken, and we have es- / caped.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Our help is in the Name of the / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
the maker of heaven and / earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_james-513-20_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;James 5:13-20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are any among you suffering? They should pray. Are any cheerful? They should sing songs of praise. Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective. Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and is brought back by another, you should know that whoever brings back a sinner from wandering will save the sinner&amp;rsquo;s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.” But Jesus said, “Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. Whoever is not against us is for us. For truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell, where their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness, how can you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Proverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A capable wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.&lt;br&gt;
The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.&lt;br&gt;
She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.&lt;br&gt;
She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.&lt;br&gt;
She is like the ships of the merchant, she brings her food from far away.&lt;br&gt;
She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and tasks for her servant-girls.&lt;br&gt;
She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.&lt;br&gt;
She girds herself with strength, and makes her arms strong.&lt;br&gt;
She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.&lt;br&gt;
She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.&lt;br&gt;
She opens her hand to the poor, and reaches out her hands to the needy.&lt;br&gt;
She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all her household are clothed in crimson.&lt;br&gt;
She makes herself coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.&lt;br&gt;
Her husband is known in the city gates, taking his seat among the elders of the land.&lt;br&gt;
She makes linen garments and sells them; she supplies the merchant with sashes.&lt;br&gt;
Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.&lt;br&gt;
She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.&lt;br&gt;
She looks well to the ways of her household, 			and does not eat the bread of idleness.&lt;br&gt;
Her children rise up and call her happy; 			her husband too, and he praises her:&lt;br&gt;
“Many women have done excellently, 			but you surpass them all.”&lt;br&gt;
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, 			but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.&lt;br&gt;
Give her a share in the fruit of her hands, 			and let her works praise her in the city gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beatus vir qui non abiit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the / wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
nor lingered in the way of sinners,&lt;br&gt;
nor sat in the seats of the / scornful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their delight is in the law of the / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and they meditate on his law day and / night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,&lt;br&gt;
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not / wither; *&lt;br&gt;
everything they do shall / prosper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is not so with the / wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
they are like chaff which the wind blows a- / way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment / comes, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the sinner in the council of the / righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For the LORD knows the way of the / righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the way of the wicked is / doomed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_james-313-437-8a_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;James 3:13-4:3,7-8a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom. But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth. Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish. For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy. And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those conflicts and disputes among you, where do they come from? Do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you? You want something and do not have it; so you commit murder. And you covet something and cannot obtain it; so you engage in disputes and conflicts. You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order to spend what you get on your pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it; for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands, and they will kill him, and three days after being killed, he will rise again.” But they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the way?” But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest. He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.” Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Proverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.&lt;br&gt;
At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:&lt;br&gt;
“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?&lt;br&gt;
How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?&lt;br&gt;
Give heed to my reproof;&lt;br&gt;
I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.&lt;br&gt;
Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,&lt;br&gt;
and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,&lt;br&gt;
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,&lt;br&gt;
when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.&lt;br&gt;
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.&lt;br&gt;
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,&lt;br&gt;
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.&lt;br&gt;
For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;&lt;br&gt;
but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies. Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell. For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue&amp;ndash; a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water? Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

God is Love: let heaven adore him;&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: let earth rejoice;&lt;br&gt;
let creation sing before him,&lt;br&gt;

God who laid the earth&amp;rsquo;s foundation,&lt;br&gt;

And when human hearts are breaking&lt;br&gt;
under sorrow&amp;rsquo;s iron rod,&lt;br&gt;
then they find that selfsame aching&lt;br&gt;
deep within the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: and though with blindness&lt;br&gt;
sin afflicts all human life,&lt;br&gt;
God&amp;rsquo;s eternal loving-kindness&lt;br&gt;
guides us through our earthly strife.&lt;br&gt;
Sin and death and hell shall never&lt;br&gt;
o&amp;rsquo;er us final triumph gain;&lt;br&gt;
God is Love, so Love for ever&lt;br&gt;
o&amp;rsquo;er the universe must reign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they answered him, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah.” And he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favour is better than silver or gold.&lt;br&gt;
The rich and the poor have this in common: the LORD is the maker of them all.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of anger will fail.&lt;br&gt;
Those who are generous are blessed, for they share their bread with the poor.&lt;br&gt;
Do not rob the poor because they are poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD pleads their cause and despoils of life those who despoil them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount / Zion, *&lt;br&gt;
which cannot be moved, but stands fast for / ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The hills stand about Je- / rusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
so does the LORD stand round about his people,&lt;br&gt;
from this time forth for ever- / more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	The scepter of the wicked shall not hold sway over the land allotted to the / just, *&lt;br&gt;
so that the just shall not put their hands to / evil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Show your goodness, O LORD, to those who are / good *&lt;br&gt;
and to those who are true of / heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;_last-half-of-tone_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last half of tone:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	As for those who turn aside to crooked ways,&lt;br&gt;
the LORD will lead them away with the evil- / doers; *&lt;br&gt;
but peace be upon / Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ? For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in, and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say, “Have a seat here, please,” while to the one who is poor you say, “Stand there,” or, “Sit at my feet,” have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters. Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court? Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.[ For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty. For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you? If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,” and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus set out and went away to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice, but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet. Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. He said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.” But she answered him, “Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” Then he said to her, “For saying that, you may go—the demon has left your daughter.” So she went home, found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him. He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue. Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. Then Jesus ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. They were astounded beyond measure, saying, “He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here today to proclaim our support and our blessing on these our students, faculty, and staff of our church school, public and private schools, homeschools, trade schools, and colleges and universities. Learning and growth are central ideas in the Kingdom of God: they are the invitation of God so that we might grow into fullness of God’s intention and, always connected to the vine who is Jesus, bear much good fruit for the blessing of the whole world. Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O Eternal God, bless all schools, colleges and universities, that they may be lively centers for sound learning, new discovery, and the pursuit of wisdom; grant that those who teach and those who learn may find you to be the source of all truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sanctify this water, we pray you, by the power of your Holy Spirit, as a reminder of our baptism; and as this water is sprinkled on these students and teachers, and on their backpacks and other instruments of learning and service, may they be strengthened in memory, reason, and skill. Grant that these pocket crosses [or other tags or tokens], carried in their backpacks, may remind them of your love and presence throughout the day as they learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, you were present at the beginning. Be with us as we begin a new school year. Comfort us when we are unsure of our new surroundings. Strengthen us when we stumble, and help us to remember that your light shines in all places. All this we ask through you, our Creator, Redeemer, and Sustainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.&lt;br&gt;
Look, there he stands behind our wall,&lt;br&gt;

My beloved speaks and says to me:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away;&lt;br&gt;

The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come,&lt;br&gt;

The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger; for your anger does not produce God&amp;rsquo;s righteousness. Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves. For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror; for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like. But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act-they will be blessed in their doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them. (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands, thus observing the tradition of the elders; and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it; and there are also many other traditions that they observe, the washing of cups, pots, and bronze kettles.) So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?” He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;&lt;br&gt;
in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.” For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder, adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven. He said, “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who walk before you with all their heart, the covenant that you kept for your servant my father David as you declared to him; you promised with your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand. Therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David that which you promised him, saying, ‘There shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’ Therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant my father David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built! Regard your servant’s prayer and his plea, O LORD my God, heeding the cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today; that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may heed the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. Hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place; O hear in heaven your dwelling place; heed and forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a distant land because of your name —for they shall hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—when a foreigner comes and prays toward this house, then hear in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and so that they may know that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built.&lt;/p&gt;

and the God of gods will reveal himself in / Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my / prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of / Jacob.&lt;br&gt;

and look upon the face of your A- / nointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own / room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the / wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and / shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and / glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD with- / hold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with in- / tegrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of / hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in / you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness. As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace. With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints. Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I must speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.” He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?” But Jesus, being aware that his disciples were complaining about it, said to them, “Does this offend you? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But among you there are some who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe, and who was the one that would betray him. And he said, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him. So Jesus asked the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?” Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven. He said, “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who walk before you with all their heart, the covenant that you kept for your servant my father David as you declared to him; you promised with your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand. Therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David that which you promised him, saying, ‘There shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’ Therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant my father David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built! Regard your servant’s prayer and his plea, O LORD my God, heeding the cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today; that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may heed the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. Hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place; O hear in heaven your dwelling place; heed and forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Likewise when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a distant land because of your name —for they shall hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—when a foreigner comes and prays toward this house, then hear in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and so that they may know that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built.&lt;/p&gt;

a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;

than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power. Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness. As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace. With all of these, take the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints. Pray also for me, so that when I speak, a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I must speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.” He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?” But Jesus, being aware that his disciples were complaining about it, said to them, “Does this offend you? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But among you there are some who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe, and who was the one that would betray him. And he said, “For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him. So Jesus asked the twelve, “Do you also wish to go away?” Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom can we go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the city of David. The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David; only, he sacrificed and offered incense at the high places. The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the principal high place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask what I should give you.” And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you; and you have kept for him this great and steadfast love, and have given him a son to sit on his throne today. And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David, although I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great people, so numerous they cannot be numbered or counted. Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, able to discern between good and evil; for who can govern this your great people?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, I now do according to your word. Indeed I give you a wise and discerning mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you shall arise after you. I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor all your life; no other king shall compare with you. If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-111&#34;&gt;Psalm 111&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confitebor tibi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
I will give thanks to the LORD with my / whole heart, *&lt;br&gt;
in the assembly of the upright, in the congre- / gation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Great are the deeds of the / LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
they are studied by all who de- / light in them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	His work is full of majesty and / splendor, *&lt;br&gt;
and his righteousness endures for / ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He makes his marvelous works to be re- / membered; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is gracious and full of com- / passion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He gives food to those who / fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
he is ever mindful of his / covenant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He has shown his people the power of his / works *&lt;br&gt;
in giving them the lands of the / nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The works of his hands are faithfulness and / justice; *&lt;br&gt;
all his commandments are / sure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	They stand fast for ever and / ever, *&lt;br&gt;
because they are done in truth and / equity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He sent redemption to his people;&lt;br&gt;
he commanded his covenant for / ever; *&lt;br&gt;
holy and awesome is his / Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of / wisdom; *&lt;br&gt;
those who act accordingly have a good understanding;&lt;br&gt;
his praise endures for / ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil. So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
O love of God, how strong and true,&lt;br&gt;
eternal and yet ever new;&lt;br&gt;
uncomprehended and unbought,&lt;br&gt;

We read thee best in him who came&lt;br&gt;
to bear for us the cross of shame,&lt;br&gt;
sent by the Father from on high,&lt;br&gt;
our life to live, our death to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

still more in resurrection light&lt;br&gt;
we read the fullness of thy might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day; for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-125&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-125&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the city of David. The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David; only, he sacrificed and offered incense at the high places. The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the principal high place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask what I should give you.” And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you; and you have kept for him this great and steadfast love, and have given him a son to sit on his throne today. And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David, although I am only a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of the people whom you have chosen, a great people, so numerous they cannot be numbered or counted. Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, able to discern between good and evil; for who can govern this your great people?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches, or for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, I now do according to your word. Indeed I give you a wise and discerning mind; no one like you has been before you and no one like you shall arise after you. I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor all your life; no other king shall compare with you. If you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil. So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day; for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king, David, ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders concerning Absalom. So the army went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. The men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the slaughter there was great on that day, twenty thousand men. The battle spread over the face of all the country; and the forest claimed more victims that day than the sword. Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. His head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ten young men, Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him, and killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, “Good tidings for my lord the king! For the Lord has vindicated you this day, delivering you from the power of all who rose up against you.” The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up to do you harm, be like that young man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De profundis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD;&lt;br&gt;
LORD, hear my / voice; *&lt;br&gt;
let your ears consider well the voice of my suppli- / cation.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting away falsehood, let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors, for we are members of one another. Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not make room for the devil. Thieves must give up stealing; rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands, so as to have something to share with the needy. Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption. Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you. Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” Jesus answered them, “Do not complain among yourselves. No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day. It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father. Very truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the wife of Uriah heard that her husband was dead, she made lamentation for him. When the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD, and the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds; but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. He brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his meager fare, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him. Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was loath to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared that for the guest who had come to him.” Then David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man. He said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die; he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul; I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added as much more. Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, for you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife. Thus says the LORD: I will raise up trouble against you from within your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this very sun. For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.” David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving- / kindness; *&lt;br&gt;

and done what is evil in your / sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

a sinner from my mother&amp;rsquo;s / womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For behold, you look for truth deep with- / in me, *&lt;br&gt;
and will make me understand wisdom / secretly&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be / pure; *&lt;br&gt;
wash me, and I shall be clean in- / deed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Make me hear of joy and / gladness, *&lt;br&gt;
that the body you have broken may re- / joice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Hide your face from my / sins *&lt;br&gt;
and blot out all my in- / iquities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Create in me a clean heart, O / God, *&lt;br&gt;
and renew a right spirit with- / in me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Cast me not away from your / presence *&lt;br&gt;
and take not your holy Spirit from / me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all. But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ&amp;rsquo;s gift. Therefore it is said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(When it says, &amp;ldquo;He ascended,&amp;rdquo; what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.) The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people&amp;rsquo;s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body&amp;rsquo;s growth in building itself up in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, when the people who remained after the feeding of the five thousand saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.” Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.” So they said to him, “What sign are you going to give us then, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” Then Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened, late one afternoon, when David rose from his couch and was walking about on the roof of the king’s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; the woman was very beautiful. David sent someone to inquire about the woman. It was reported, “This is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” So David sent messengers to get her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself after her period.) Then she returned to her house. The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, “I am pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So David sent word to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David. When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the people fared, and how the war was going. Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” Uriah went out of the king’s house, and there followed him a present from the king. But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “You have just come from a journey. Why did you not go down to your house?” Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah remain in booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing.” Then David said to Uriah, “Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day. On the next day, David invited him to eat and drink in his presence and made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. In the letter he wrote, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, so that he may be struck down and die.”&lt;/p&gt;

there is none who does any / good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD looks down from heaven upon us / all, *&lt;br&gt;
to see if there is any who is wise,&lt;br&gt;
if there is one who seeks after / God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Every one has proved faithless;&lt;br&gt;
all alike have turned / bad; *&lt;br&gt;
there is none who does good; no, not / one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Have they no knowledge, all those evil- / doers *&lt;br&gt;
who eat up my people like bread&lt;br&gt;
and do not call upon the / LORD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	See how they tremble with / fear, *&lt;br&gt;
because God is in the company of the / righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Their aim is to confound the plans of the af- / flicted, *&lt;br&gt;
but the LORD is their / refuge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Oh, that Israel&amp;rsquo;s deliverance would come out of / Zion! *&lt;br&gt;
when the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,&lt;br&gt;
Jacob will rejoice and Israel be / glad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias. A large crowd kept following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick. Jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near. When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?” He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do. Philip answered him, “Six months’ wages would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.” One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are they among so many people?” Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand in all. Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing may be lost.” So they gathered them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets. When the people saw the sign that he had done, they began to say, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were terrified. But he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.” Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the king was settled in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, “See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent.” Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that you have in mind; for the LORD is with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan: Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the Lord: Are you the one to build me a house to live in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent and a tabernacle. Wherever I have moved about among all the people of Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the tribal leaders of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called “the uncircumcision” by those who are called “the circumcision” —a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands— remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. He said to them, “Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them. As he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored the boat. When they got out of the boat, people at once recognized him, and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he went, into villages or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed.&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. David and all the people with him set out and went from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned on the cherubim. They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart with the ark of God; and Ahio went in front of the ark. David and all the house of Israel were dancing before the LORD with all their might, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing; and when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. David danced before the Lord with all his might; David was girded with a linen ephod. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being before the LORD. When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts, and distributed food among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people went back to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight he has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&amp;rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King Herod heard of Jesus and his disciples, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; and for this reason these powers are at work in him.” But others said, “It is Elijah.” And others said, “It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her. For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed; and yet he liked to listen to him. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of Galilee. When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it.” And he solemnly swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.” She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” She replied, “The head of John the baptizer.” Immediately she rushed back to the king and requested, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” The king was deeply grieved; yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests, he did not want to refuse her. Immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.&lt;/p&gt;

He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,&lt;br&gt;
how passing thought and fantasy,&lt;br&gt;
that God, the Son of God, should take&lt;br&gt;
our mortal form for mortals&amp;rsquo; sake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
For us baptized, for us he bore&lt;br&gt;
his holy fast and hungered sore;&lt;br&gt;
for us temptations sharp he knew;&lt;br&gt;
for us the tempter overthrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
For us he prayed; for us he taught;&lt;br&gt;
for us his daily works he wrought:&lt;br&gt;
by words and signs and actions, thus&lt;br&gt;
still seeking not himself, but us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
For us to wicked hands betrayed,&lt;br&gt;
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,&lt;br&gt;
he bore the shameful cross and death;&lt;br&gt;
for us gave up his dying breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For us he rose from death again;&lt;br&gt;
for us he went on high to reign;&lt;br&gt;
for us he sent his Spirit here&lt;br&gt;
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
All glory to our Lord and God&lt;br&gt;
for love so deep, so high, so broad;&lt;br&gt;
the Trinity whom we adore&lt;br&gt;
forever and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh. For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in. The LORD said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel.” So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inwards. And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat. On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. But if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me, even considering the exceptional character of the revelations. Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.” And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them. And he was amazed at their unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics. He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent. They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David intoned this lamentation over Saul and his son Jonathan. (He ordered that The Song of the Bow be taught to the people of Judah; it is written in the Book of Jashar.) He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your glory, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places! How the mighty have fallen!&lt;br&gt;
Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon;&lt;br&gt;
or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.&lt;br&gt;
You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor bounteous fields!&lt;br&gt;
For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, anointed with oil no more.&lt;br&gt;
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,&lt;br&gt;
the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, nor the sword of Saul return empty.&lt;br&gt;
Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided;&lt;br&gt;
they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.&lt;br&gt;
O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with crimson, in luxury, who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.&lt;br&gt;
How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle!&lt;br&gt;
Jonathan lies slain upon your high places. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;&lt;br&gt;
greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.&lt;br&gt;
How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-130&#34;&gt;Psalm 130&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De profundis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD;&lt;br&gt;
LORD, hear my / voice; *&lt;br&gt;
let your ears consider well the voice of my suppli- / cation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	If you, LORD, were to note what is done a- / miss, *&lt;br&gt;

therefore you shall be / feared.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6	O Israel, wait for the / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
for with the LORD there is / mercy;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you excel in everything&amp;ndash; in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in utmost eagerness, and in our love for you&amp;ndash; so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others. For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich. And in this matter I am giving my advice: it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something&amp;ndash; now finish doing it, so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means. For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has&amp;ndash; not according to what one does not have. I do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you, but it is a question of a fair balance between your present abundance and their need, so that their abundance may be for your need, in order that there may be a fair balance. As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The one who had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too little.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea. Then one of the leaders of the synagogue named Jairus came and, when he saw him, fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.” So he went with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him. Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years. She had endured much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had; and she was no better, but rather grew worse. She had heard about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, for she said, “If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well.” Immediately her hemorrhage stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. Immediately aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say, ‘Who touched me?’” He looked all around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was still speaking, some people came from the leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further?” But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. When they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue, he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. When he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. Then he put them all outside, and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha cum,” which means, “Little girl, get up!” And immediately the girl got up and began to walk about (she was twelve years of age). At this they were overcome with amazement. He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” And the Philistine said, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together.” When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry. Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers. As he talked with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.” David said, “The LORD, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you!” Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail. David strapped Saul’s sword over the armor, and he tried in vain to walk, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these; for I am not used to them.” So David removed them. Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the field.” But David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This very day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army this very day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’s and he will give you into our hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Philistine drew nearer to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work together with Christ, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At an acceptable time I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone&amp;rsquo;s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see&amp;ndash; we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spoken frankly to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you. There is no restriction in our affections, but only in yours. In return&amp;ndash; I speak as to children&amp;ndash; open wide your hearts also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evening had come, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go across to the other side.” And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him. A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?” He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm. He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?” And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-2&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our  sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter his gates with thanksgiving;&lt;br&gt;

a refuge in time of / trouble.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Those who know your Name will put their / trust in you, *&lt;br&gt;
for you never forsake those who seek you, O / LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

proclaim to the peoples the things he has / done.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	The Avenger of blood will re- / member them; *&lt;br&gt;
he will not forget the cry of the af- / flicted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Have pity on me, O / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me,&lt;br&gt;
O you who lift me up from the gate of / death;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in your sal- / vation *&lt;br&gt;
in the gates of the city of / Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and in the snare they set is their own foot / caught.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	The LORD is known by his acts of / justice; *&lt;br&gt;
the wicked are trapped in the works of their own / hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

let them be judged be- / fore you.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” And the Philistine said, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together.” When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry. Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers. As he talked with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.” David said, “The LORD, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you!” Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail. David strapped Saul’s sword over the armor, and he tried in vain to walk, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these; for I am not used to them.” So David removed them. Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the field.” But David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This very day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army this very day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’s and he will give you into our hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Philistine drew nearer to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;br&gt;
And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;br&gt;
Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;br&gt;
Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;br&gt;
Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work together with Christ, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At an acceptable time I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone&amp;rsquo;s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see&amp;ndash; we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spoken frankly to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you. There is no restriction in our affections, but only in yours. In return&amp;ndash; I speak as to children&amp;ndash; open wide your hearts also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evening had come, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go across to the other side.” And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him. A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?” He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm. He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?” And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him. He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” And the Philistine said, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together.” When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment as the army was going forth to the battle line, shouting the war cry. Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the ranks, and went and greeted his brothers. As he talked with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David said to Saul, “Let no one’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.” David said, “The LORD, who saved me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will save me from the hand of this Philistine.” So Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you!” Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail. David strapped Saul’s sword over the armor, and he tried in vain to walk, for he was not used to them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these; for I am not used to them.” So David removed them. Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the wadi, and put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philistine came on and drew near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was only a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the field.” But David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This very day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the Philistine army this very day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD’s and he will give you into our hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Philistine drew nearer to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. David put his hand in his bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;

He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work together with Christ, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At an acceptable time I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone&amp;rsquo;s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see&amp;ndash; we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spoken frankly to you Corinthians; our heart is wide open to you. There is no restriction in our affections, but only in yours. In return&amp;ndash; I speak as to children&amp;ndash; open wide your hearts also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When evening had come, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go across to the other side.” And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him. A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?” He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm. He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?” And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”&lt;/p&gt;

creator of heaven and earth.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;
and the life everlasting.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD was sorry that he had made Saul king over Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.” Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.” Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is now before the LORD.” But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.” Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.” He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.” Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-20&#34;&gt;Psalm 20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exaudiat te Dominus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	May the LORD answer you in the day of / trouble, *&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the God of Jacob de- / fend you;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Send you help from his holy / place *&lt;br&gt;
and strengthen you out of / Zion;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Remember all your / offerings *&lt;br&gt;
and accept your burnt / sacrifice;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Grant you your heart&amp;rsquo;s de- / sire *&lt;br&gt;
and prosper all your / plans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	We will shout for joy at your victory&lt;br&gt;
and triumph in the Name of our / God; *&lt;br&gt;
may the LORD grant all your re- / quests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his an- / ointed; *&lt;br&gt;
he will answer him out of his holy heaven,&lt;br&gt;
with the victorious strength of his right / hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Some put their trust in chariots and some in / horses, *&lt;br&gt;
but we will call upon the Name of the LORD our / God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	They collapse and fall / down, *&lt;br&gt;
but we will arise and stand / upright.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	O LORD, give victory to the / king *&lt;br&gt;
and answer us when we / call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-corinthians-56-1011-1314-17_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Corinthians 5:6-10,(11-13),14-17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord&amp;ndash; for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others; but we ourselves are well known to God, and I hope that we are also well known to your consciences. We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast in outward appearance and not in the heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.] For the love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them. From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new!&lt;/p&gt;

The earth produces of itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. But when the grain is ripe, at once he goes in with his sickle, because the harvest has come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it? It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything in private to his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, “You are old and your sons do not follow in your ways; appoint for us, then, a king to govern us, like other nations.” But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to govern us.” Samuel prayed to the LORD, and the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. Just as they have done to me, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so also they are doing to you. Now then, listen to their voice; only—you shall solemnly warn them, and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Samuel reported all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots; [and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers. He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers. He will take one-tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and his courtiers.] He will take your male and female slaves, and the best of your cattle and donkeys, and put them to his work. He will take one-tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves. And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; they said, “No! but we are determined to have a king over us, so that we also may be like other nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed offerings of well-being before the LORD, and there Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.]&lt;/p&gt;

that great is the glory of the / LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Though the LORD be high, he cares for the / lowly; *&lt;br&gt;
he perceives the haughty from a- / far.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me / safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;&lt;br&gt;
your right hand shall / save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The LORD will make good his purpose for / me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, your love endures for ever;&lt;br&gt;
do not abandon the works of your / hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripture—“I believed, and so I spoke” —we also believe, and so we speak, because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will bring us with you into his presence. Yes, everything is for your sake, so that grace, as it extends to more and more people, may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure, because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd came together again, so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat. When his family heard it, they went out to restrain him, for people were saying, “He has gone out of his mind.” And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons.” And he called them to him, and spoke to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come. But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man; then indeed the house can be plundered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”— for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside, they sent to him and called him. A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, asking for you.” And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. The word of the LORD was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his room; the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was. Then the LORD called, “Samuel! Samuel!” and he said, “Here I am!” and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. The LORD called again, “Samuel!” Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. The LORD called Samuel again, a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” [Then the LORD said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears of it tingle. On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. For I have told him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them. Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel lay there until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “Here I am.” Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.” So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. Then he said, “It is the LORD; let him do what seems good to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the LORD.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, you have searched me out and / known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from a- / far.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You trace my journeys and my / resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my / ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Indeed, there is not a word on my / lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it alto- / gether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	You press upon me behind and be- / fore *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand up- / on me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Such knowledge is too / wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot at- / tain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	For you yourself created my inmost / parts; *&lt;br&gt;
you knit me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s / womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	I will thank you because I am marvelously / made; *&lt;br&gt;
your works are wonderful, and I know it / well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	My body was not hidden from / you, *&lt;br&gt;
while I was being made in secret&lt;br&gt;
and woven in the depths of the / earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;&lt;br&gt;
all of them were written in your / book; *&lt;br&gt;
they were fashioned day by day,&lt;br&gt;
when as yet there was / none of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	How deep I find your thoughts, O / God! *&lt;br&gt;
how great is the / sum of them!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the / sand; *&lt;br&gt;
to count them all, my life span would need to&lt;br&gt;
be like / yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-corinthians-45-12_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Corinthians 4:5-12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake. For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies. For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sabbath Jesus and his disciples were going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.” Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand. They watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come forward.” Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-61-8_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 6:1-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.” Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&amp;ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&amp;ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.” Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand of the LORD came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, “Mortal, can these bones live?” I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.” I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to me, “Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’ Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken and will act,” says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedic, anima mea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	O LORD, how manifold are your / works! *&lt;br&gt;
in wisdom you have made them all;&lt;br&gt;
the earth is full of your / creatures.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	Yonder is the great and wide sea&lt;br&gt;
with its living things too many to / number, *&lt;br&gt;
creatures both small and / great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	There move the ships,&lt;br&gt;
and there is that Lev- / iathan, *&lt;br&gt;
which you have made for the / sport of it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	All of them look to / you *&lt;br&gt;
to give them their food in due / season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	You give it to them; they / gather it; *&lt;br&gt;
you open your hand, and they are filled with good / things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	You hide your face, and they are / terrified; *&lt;br&gt;
you take away their breath,&lt;br&gt;
and they die and return to their / dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are cre- / ated; *&lt;br&gt;
and so you renew the face of the / earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;32	May the glory of the LORD endure for / ever; *&lt;br&gt;
may the LORD rejoice in all his / works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33	He looks at the earth and it / trembles; *&lt;br&gt;
he touches the mountains and they / smoke.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I / live; *&lt;br&gt;
I will praise my God while I have my / being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35	May these words of mine / please him; *&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in the / LORD.&lt;br&gt;
37	&lt;strong&gt;Bless the LORD, O my / soul. *&lt;br&gt;
Halle- / lujah!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&amp;ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s deeds of power.&amp;rdquo; All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &amp;ldquo;What does this mean?&amp;rdquo; But others sneered and said, &amp;ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In the last days it will be, God declares,&lt;br&gt;
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,&lt;br&gt;
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.&lt;br&gt;
Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&lt;br&gt;
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.&lt;br&gt;
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s great and glorious day.&lt;br&gt;
Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, ”When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said, &amp;ldquo;Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus&amp;ndash; for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry. So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us&amp;ndash; one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection.&amp;rdquo; So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, you know everyone&amp;rsquo;s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1&#34;&gt;Psalm 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beatus vir qui non abiit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the / wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
nor lingered in the way of sinners,&lt;br&gt;
nor sat in the seats of the / scornful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their delight is in the law of the / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and they meditate on his law day and / night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,&lt;br&gt;
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not / wither; *&lt;br&gt;
everything they do shall / prosper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is not so with the / wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
they are like chaff which the wind blows a- / way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment / comes, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the sinner in the council of the / righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For the LORD knows the way of the / righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the way of the wicked is / doomed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son. Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son. And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus prayed for his disciples, “I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything you have given me is from you; for the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them in your name that you have given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost, so that the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you, and I speak these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to protect them from the evil one. They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as surpass our understanding: Pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you in all things and above all things, may obtain your promises, which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&amp;rdquo; So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith. Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, “As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a wilderness road.) So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.” So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him. Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eunuch asked Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus. As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?” He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-2224-30&#34;&gt;Psalm 22:24-30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great as- / sembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who / worship him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;

he rules over the / nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in / worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall be- / fore him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall / serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;s for / ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people / yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has / done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. God&amp;rsquo;s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God. So we have known and believe the love that God has for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. We love because he first loved us. Those who say, &amp;ldquo;I love God,&amp;rdquo; and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen. The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, ”I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a wilderness road.) So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.” So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him. Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eunuch asked Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus. As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?” He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.&lt;/p&gt;

my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. God&amp;rsquo;s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God. So we have known and believe the love that God has for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. We love because he first loved us. Those who say, &amp;ldquo;I love God,&amp;rdquo; and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen. The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, ”I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.”&lt;/p&gt;

creator of heaven and earth.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;
and the life everlasting.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, &amp;ldquo;By what power or by what name did you do this?&amp;rdquo; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &amp;ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead. This Jesus is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;rsquo;the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my / shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in / want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green / pastures *&lt;br&gt;
and leads me beside still / waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my / soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s / sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no / evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they / comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who / trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running / over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my / life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for / ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us&amp;ndash; and we ought to lay down our lives for one another. How does God&amp;rsquo;s love abide in anyone who has the world&amp;rsquo;s goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God; and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

I come with joy to meet my Lord,&lt;br&gt;
forgiven, loved, and free,&lt;br&gt;

As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,&lt;br&gt;
each proud division ends.&lt;br&gt;

and strangers now are friends.&lt;/p&gt;

His presence, always near,&lt;br&gt;
is in such friendship better known,&lt;br&gt;
we see and praise him here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter addressed the people, “You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&amp;rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus stood among the disciples and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&amp;rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&amp;rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, who in the Paschal mystery established the new covenant of reconciliation: Grant that all who have been reborn into the fellowship of Christ’s Body may show forth in their lives what they profess by their faith; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common. With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold. They laid it at the apostles&amp;rsquo; feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-133&#34;&gt;Psalm 133&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecce, quam bonum!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Oh, how good and pleasant it / is, *&lt;br&gt;
when brethren live together in / unity!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	It is like fine oil upon the / head *&lt;br&gt;
that runs down upon the / beard,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Upon the beard of / Aaron, *&lt;br&gt;
and runs down upon the collar of his / robe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is like the dew of / Hermon *&lt;br&gt;
that falls upon the hills of / Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	For there the LORD has ordained the / blessing: *&lt;br&gt;
life for ever / more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-john-11-22_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 John 1:1-2:2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life&amp;ndash; this life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us&amp;ndash; we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true; but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sequence-hymn-_we-know-that-christ-is-raised_-hymnal-296&#34;&gt;Sequence Hymn: &lt;em&gt;We know that Christ is raised&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 296)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
We know that Christ is raised and dies no more.&lt;br&gt;
Embraced by death he broke its fearful hold;&lt;br&gt;
and our despair he turned to blazing joy.&lt;br&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
We share by water in his saving death.&lt;br&gt;
Reborn we share with him an Easter life&lt;br&gt;
as living members of a living Christ.&lt;br&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
The Father&amp;rsquo;s splendor clothes the Son with life.&lt;br&gt;
The Spirit&amp;rsquo;s power shakes the Church of God.&lt;br&gt;
Baptized we live with God the Three in One.&lt;br&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
A new creation comes to life and grows&lt;br&gt;
as Christ&amp;rsquo;s new body takes on flesh and blood.&lt;br&gt;
The universe restored and whole will sing:&lt;br&gt;
Alleluia! Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &amp;ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&amp;rdquo; But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;rdquo; Thomas answered him, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and my God!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.&lt;/p&gt;

O Lamb of God, I come, I come.&lt;/p&gt;

Just as I am, thy love unknown&lt;br&gt;

now to be thine, yea, thine alone,&lt;br&gt;
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.&lt;/p&gt;

here for a season, then above:&lt;br&gt;
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is / good; *&lt;br&gt;
his mercy endures for / ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let Israel now pro- / claim, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His mercy endures for / ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14	The LORD is my strength and my / song, *&lt;br&gt;
and he has become my sal- / vation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15	There is a sound of exultation and / victory *&lt;br&gt;
in the tents of the / righteous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the right hand of the LORD is exalted!&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD has / triumphed!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17	I shall not die, but / live, *&lt;br&gt;
and declare the works of the / LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18	The LORD has punished me / sorely, *&lt;br&gt;
but he did not hand me over to / death.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19	Open for me the gates of / righteousness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will enter them;&lt;br&gt;
I will offer thanks to the / LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20	&amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he who is righteous may / enter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21	I will give thanks to you, for you / answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and have become my sal- / vation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22	The same stone which the builders re- / jected *&lt;br&gt;
has become the chief / cornerstone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;23	This is the LORD&amp;rsquo;S / doing, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is marvelous in our / eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	On this day the LORD has / acted; *&lt;br&gt;
we will rejoice and be / glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&amp;ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&amp;ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;br&gt;
Assist us mercifully with your help, O Lord God of our salvation, that we may enter with joy upon the contemplation of those mighty acts, whereby you have given us life and immortality; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Reading from Mark’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were approaching Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, ‘Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, “Why are you doing this?” just say this, “The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.” ’ They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they were untying it, some of the bystanders said to them, ‘What are you doing, untying the colt?’ They told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it. Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields. Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hosanna!&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David!&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest heaven!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple; and when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Mark 11.1-11a NRSV)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give him thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right to praise you, Almighty God, for the acts of love by which you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. On this day he entered the holy city of Jerusalem in triumph, and was proclaimed as King of kings by those who spread their garments and branches of palm along his way. Let these branches be for us signs of his victory, and grant that we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our King, and follow him in the way that leads to eternal life; who lives and reigns in glory with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the Lord; *&lt;br&gt;
he who is righteous may enter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and have become my salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 The same stone which the builders rejected *&lt;br&gt;
has become the chief cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 This is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s doing, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is marvelous in our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 On this day the Lord has acted; *&lt;br&gt;
we will rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord God has given me&lt;br&gt;
the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain&lt;br&gt;
the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens—&lt;br&gt;
wakens my ear&lt;br&gt;
to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord God has opened my ear,&lt;br&gt;
and I was not rebellious,&lt;br&gt;
I did not turn backwards.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me,&lt;br&gt;
and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face&lt;br&gt;
from insult and spitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord God helps me;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint,&lt;br&gt;
and I know that I shall not be put to shame;&lt;br&gt;
he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me?&lt;br&gt;
Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries?&lt;br&gt;
Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord God who helps me;&lt;br&gt;
who will declare me guilty?&lt;br&gt;
All of them will wear out like a garment;&lt;br&gt;
the moth will eat them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies&lt;br&gt;
and even to my neighbors,&lt;br&gt;
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *&lt;br&gt;
when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	It was two days before the Passover and the festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	While he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard, and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head. But some were there who said to one another in anger,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Why was the ointment wasted in this way? For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And they scolded her. But Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me. For you always have the poor with you, and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me. She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial. Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. When they heard it, they were greatly pleased, and promised to give him money. So he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, his disciples said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	So he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, “The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found everything as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, he came with the twelve. And when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	They began to be distressed and to say to him one after another,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Surely, not I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	While they were eating, he took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to them, and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Take; this is my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and all of them drank from it. He said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. And Jesus said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	You will all become deserters; for it is written,&lt;br&gt;
“I will strike the shepherd,&lt;br&gt;
and the sheep will be scattered.”&lt;br&gt;
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Peter said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Even though all become deserters, I will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Truly I tell you, this day, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And all of them said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Sit here while I pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	He took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be distressed and agitated. And he said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and keep awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Abba, Father, for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour? Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him. He came a third time and said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. Now the betrayer had given them a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judas:&lt;/em&gt;	The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	So when he came, he went up to him at once and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judas:&lt;/em&gt;	Rabbi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Judas kissed him. Then they laid hands on him and arrested him. But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	All of them deserted him and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him, but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled. Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire. Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none. For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony did not agree. Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	We heard him say, “I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But even on this point their testimony did not agree. Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H Priest:&lt;/em&gt;	Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest asked him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H Priest:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	I am; and “you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power”, and “coming with the clouds of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H Priest:&lt;/em&gt;	Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy! What is your decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	All of them condemned him as deserving death. Some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to strike him, saying to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Prophesy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	The guards also took him over and beat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came by. When she saw Peter warming himself, she stared at him and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant:&lt;/em&gt;	You also were with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But he denied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	I do not know or understand what you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And he went out into the forecourt. Then the cock crowed. And the servant-girl, on seeing him, began again to say to the bystanders,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant:&lt;/em&gt;	This man is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But again he denied it. Then after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But he began to curse, and he swore an oath,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	I do not know this man you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And Peter broke down and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. Pilate asked him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you the King of the Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	You say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then the chief priests accused him of many things. Pilate asked him again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Have you no answer? See how many charges they bring against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for whom they asked. Now a man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection. So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom. Then he answered them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead. Pilate spoke to them again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	They shouted back,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Crucify him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Why, what evil has he done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Crucify him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor’s headquarters); and they called together the whole cohort. And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him. And they began saluting him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Hail, King of the Jews!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	They struck his head with a reed, spat upon him, and knelt down in homage to him. After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	They compelled a passer-by, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross; it was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus. Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Congregation stands at this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt; And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it. And they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots to decide what each should take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him. The inscription of the charge against him read, ‘The King of the Jews.’ And with him they crucified two bandits, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	This means, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ When some of the bystanders heard it, they said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Listen, he is calling for Elijah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SILENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Truly this man was God’s Son!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	There were also women looking on from a distance; among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. These used to follow him and provided for him when he was in Galilee; and there were many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evening had come, and since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time. When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. Then Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you alone can bring into order the unruly wills and affections of sinners: Grant your people grace to love what you command and desire what you promise; that, among the swift and varied changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, “Know the LORD,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miserere mei, Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; *&lt;br&gt;
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Wash me through and through from my wickedness *&lt;br&gt;
and cleanse me from my sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For I know my transgressions, *&lt;br&gt;
and my sin is ever before me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Against you only have I sinned *&lt;br&gt;
and done what is evil in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	And so you are justified when you speak *&lt;br&gt;
and upright in your judgment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *&lt;br&gt;
a sinner from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *&lt;br&gt;
and will make me understand wisdom secretly&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *&lt;br&gt;
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Make me hear of joy and gladness, *&lt;br&gt;
that the body you have broken may rejoice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Hide your face from my sins *&lt;br&gt;
and blot out all my iniquities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Create in me a clean heart, O God, *&lt;br&gt;
and renew a right spirit within me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Cast me not away from your presence *&lt;br&gt;
and take not your holy Spirit from me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Give me the joy of your saving help again *&lt;br&gt;
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-55-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 5:5-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are my Son, today I have begotten you”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as he says also in another place,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mount Hor the Israelites set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; but the people became impatient on the way. The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the LORD sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.” So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.&lt;/p&gt;

and he delivered them from their distress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20	He sent forth his word and healed them *&lt;br&gt;

and the wonders he does for his children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient. All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ&amp;ndash; by grace you have been saved&amp;ndash; and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God&amp;ndash; not the result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed. But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”&lt;/p&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

how passing thought and fantasy,&lt;br&gt;
that God, the Son of God, should take&lt;br&gt;

for us the tempter overthrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
For us he prayed; for us he taught;&lt;br&gt;
for us his daily works he wrought:&lt;br&gt;
by words and signs and actions, thus&lt;br&gt;
still seeking not himself, but us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
For us to wicked hands betrayed,&lt;br&gt;
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,&lt;br&gt;
he bore the shameful cross and death;&lt;br&gt;
for us gave up his dying breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For us he rose from death again;&lt;br&gt;
for us he went on high to reign;&lt;br&gt;
for us he sent his Spirit here&lt;br&gt;
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God spoke all these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. For six days you shall labour and do all your work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not commit adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caeli enarrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *&lt;br&gt;
and the firmament shows his handiwork.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	One day tells its tale to another, *&lt;br&gt;
and one night imparts knowledge to another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Although they have no words or language, *&lt;br&gt;
and their voices are not heard,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it again; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The law of the LORD is perfect&lt;br&gt;
and revives the soul; *&lt;br&gt;
the testimony of the LORD is sure&lt;br&gt;
and gives wisdom to the innocent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The statutes of the LORD are just&lt;br&gt;
and rejoice the heart; *&lt;br&gt;
the commandment of the LORD is clear&lt;br&gt;
and gives light to the eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The fear of the LORD is clean&lt;br&gt;
and endures for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
the judgments of the LORD are true&lt;br&gt;
and righteous altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he offends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great offense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables. Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!” His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?” Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?” But he was speaking of the temple of his body. After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless. And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous.” Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him, “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.” He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. Therefore his faith “was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus began to teach his disciples that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spare us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God said to Noah and to his sons with him, “As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad te, Domine, levavi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;&lt;br&gt;
my God, I put my trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
let me not be humiliated,&lt;br&gt;
nor let my enemies triumph over me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let none who look to you be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Show me your ways, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and teach me your paths.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Lead me in your truth and teach me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are the God of my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
in you have I trusted all the day long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, *&lt;br&gt;
for they are from everlasting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; *&lt;br&gt;
remember me according to your love&lt;br&gt;
and for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Gracious and upright is the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore he teaches sinners in his way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He guides the humble in doing right *&lt;br&gt;
and teaches his way to the lowly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness *&lt;br&gt;
to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you&amp;ndash; not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho. The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; be silent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.” He responded, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.” As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, “Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake. For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no one on earth could bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus. Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what to say, for they were terrified. Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a voice, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?&lt;br&gt;
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;&lt;br&gt;
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in;&lt;br&gt;
who brings princes to naught, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.&lt;br&gt;
Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,&lt;br&gt;
when he blows upon them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.&lt;br&gt;
To whom then will you compare me, or who is my equal? says the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these?&lt;br&gt;
He who brings out their host and numbers them, calling them all by name;&lt;br&gt;
because he is great in strength, mighty in power, not one is missing.&lt;br&gt;
Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br&gt;
Have you not known? Have you not heard?&lt;br&gt;
The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.&lt;br&gt;
He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.&lt;br&gt;
He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.&lt;br&gt;
Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted;&lt;br&gt;
but those who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles,&lt;br&gt;
they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1471-1221c&#34;&gt;Psalm 147:1-12,21c&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laudate Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *&lt;br&gt;
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
he gathers the exiles of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He heals the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;
and binds up their wounds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He counts the number of the stars *&lt;br&gt;
and calls them all by their names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Great is our LORD and mighty in power; *&lt;br&gt;
there is no limit to his wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, *&lt;br&gt;
but casts the wicked to the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *&lt;br&gt;
make music to our God upon the harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He covers the heavens with clouds *&lt;br&gt;
and prepares rain for the earth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *&lt;br&gt;
and green plants to serve mankind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He provides food for flocks and herds *&lt;br&gt;
and for the young ravens when they cry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *&lt;br&gt;
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
in those who await his gracious favor. Hallelujah!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-916-23_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 9:16-23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel! For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God&amp;rsquo;s law but am under Christ&amp;rsquo;s law) so that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered around the door. And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed. And Simon and his companions hunted for him. When they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you.” He answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.” And he went throughout Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus, we are all baptized by the one Spirit into one Body and given gifts for a variety of ministries for the common good.  Our purpose is to commission these persons in the name of God and this congregation to the special ministries to which they are called. Are these persons prepared by a commitment to Christ as Lord, by regular attendance and by the knowledge of their duties, to exercise their ministry to the honor of God and the well-being of St. Thomas&amp;rsquo; and the Diocese of New Jersey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presenter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rector:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been called to a ministry in this congregation. Will you, as long as you are engaged in this work, perform it with diligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wardens and Members of the Vestry:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, with God’s help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rector:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you faithfully and reverently execute the duties of your ministry to the honor of God, and the benefit of the members of this congregation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wardens and Members of the Vestry:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, with God’s help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rector:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O Eternal God, the foundation of all wisdom and the source of all courage: Enlighten with your grace the Wardens and Members of the Vestry of this congregation, and so rule their minds and guide their counsels, that in all things they may seek your glory and promote the mission of your Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Name of God and of this congregation, I commission you as Wardens and Members of the Vestry in this Parish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-18&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Malachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord, See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight&amp;ndash; indeed, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&amp;rsquo; soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the LORD in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *&lt;br&gt;
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The sparrow has found her a house&lt;br&gt;
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *&lt;br&gt;
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,&lt;br&gt;
my King and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *&lt;br&gt;
they will always be praising you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *&lt;br&gt;
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *&lt;br&gt;
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will climb from height to height, *&lt;br&gt;
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Behold our defender, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
and look upon the face of your Anointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with integrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since God&amp;rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&amp;rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;&lt;br&gt;
for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,&lt;br&gt;
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child&amp;rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &amp;ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&amp;ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said: The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the LORD replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command. Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable. But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak—that prophet shall die.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
I will give thanks to the LORD with my / whole heart, *&lt;br&gt;
in the assembly of the upright, in the congre- / gation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Great are the deeds of the / LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
they are studied by all who de- / light in them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in giving them the lands of the / nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	The works of his hands are faithfulness and / justice; *&lt;br&gt;
all his commandments are / sure.&lt;br&gt;

because they are done in truth and / equity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

he commanded his covenant for / ever; *&lt;br&gt;
holy and awesome is his / Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of / wisdom; *&lt;br&gt;
those who act accordingly have a good understanding;&lt;br&gt;
his praise endures for / ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge; but anyone who loves God is known by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “no idol in the world really exists,” and that “there is no God but one.” Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as in fact there are many gods and many lords— yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge. Since some have become so accustomed to idols until now, they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. “Food will not bring us close to God.” We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For if others see you, who possess knowledge, eating in the temple of an idol, might they not, since their conscience is weak, be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols? So by your knowledge those weak believers for whom Christ died are destroyed. But when you thus sin against members of your family, and wound their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food is a cause of their falling, I will never eat meat, so that I may not cause one of them to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.” But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-23&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-24&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-25&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-26&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-125&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-125&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-27&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-8&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-28&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,&lt;br&gt;
how passing thought and fantasy,&lt;br&gt;
that God, the Son of God, should take&lt;br&gt;
our mortal form for mortals&amp;rsquo; sake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
For us baptized, for us he bore&lt;br&gt;
his holy fast and hungered sore;&lt;br&gt;
for us temptations sharp he knew;&lt;br&gt;
for us the tempter overthrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
For us he prayed; for us he taught;&lt;br&gt;
for us his daily works he wrought:&lt;br&gt;
by words and signs and actions, thus&lt;br&gt;
still seeking not himself, but us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
For us to wicked hands betrayed,&lt;br&gt;
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,&lt;br&gt;
he bore the shameful cross and death;&lt;br&gt;
for us gave up his dying breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For us he rose from death again;&lt;br&gt;
for us he went on high to reign;&lt;br&gt;
for us he sent his Spirit here&lt;br&gt;
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
All glory to our Lord and God&lt;br&gt;
for love so deep, so high, so broad;&lt;br&gt;
the Trinity whom we adore&lt;br&gt;
forever and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Jonah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying, “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days&amp;rsquo; walk across. Jonah began to go into the city, going a day&amp;rsquo;s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no possessions, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you fish for people.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;

as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. The word of the LORD was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his room; the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was. Then the LORD called, “Samuel! Samuel!” and he said, “Here I am!” and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. The LORD called again, “Samuel!” Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. The LORD called Samuel again, a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” [Then the LORD said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears of it tingle. On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. For I have told him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them. Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel lay there until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “Here I am.” Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.” So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. Then he said, “It is the LORD; let him do what seems good to him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the LORD.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, you have searched me out and / known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from a- / far.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You trace my journeys and my / resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my / ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Indeed, there is not a word on my / lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it alto- / gether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	You press upon me behind and be- / fore *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand up- / on me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Such knowledge is too / wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot at- / tain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	For you yourself created my inmost / parts; *&lt;br&gt;
you knit me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s / womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	I will thank you because I am marvelously / made; *&lt;br&gt;
your works are wonderful, and I know it / well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	My body was not hidden from / you, *&lt;br&gt;
while I was being made in secret&lt;br&gt;
and woven in the depths of the / earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;&lt;br&gt;
all of them were written in your / book; *&lt;br&gt;
they were fashioned day by day,&lt;br&gt;
when as yet there was / none of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	How deep I find your thoughts, O / God! *&lt;br&gt;
how great is the / sum of them!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the / sand; *&lt;br&gt;
to count them all, my life span would need to&lt;br&gt;
be like / yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food,” and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is meant not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that whoever is united to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, “The two shall be one flesh.” But anyone united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Shun fornication! Every sin that a person commits is outside the body; but the fornicator sins against the body itself. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.” Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-18&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the interior regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples. He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” Then he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They answered, “Into John’s baptism.” Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.” On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied— altogether there were about twelve of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arise, shine; for your light has come,&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.&lt;br&gt;
For darkness shall cover the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and thick darkness the peoples;&lt;br&gt;
but the Lord will arise upon you,&lt;br&gt;
and his glory will appear over you.&lt;br&gt;
Nations shall come to your light,&lt;br&gt;
and kings to the brightness of your dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lift up your eyes and look around;&lt;br&gt;
they all gather together, they come to you;&lt;br&gt;
your sons shall come from far away,&lt;br&gt;
and your daughters shall be carried on their nurses’ arms.&lt;br&gt;
Then you shall see and be radiant;&lt;br&gt;
your heart shall thrill and rejoice,&lt;br&gt;
because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you,&lt;br&gt;
the wealth of the nations shall come to you.&lt;br&gt;
A multitude of camels shall cover you,&lt;br&gt;
the young camels of Midian and Ephah;&lt;br&gt;
all those from Sheba shall come.&lt;br&gt;
They shall bring gold and frankincense,&lt;br&gt;
and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you,&lt;br&gt;
the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;&lt;br&gt;
they shall be acceptable on my altar,&lt;br&gt;
and I will glorify my glorious house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these that fly like a cloud,&lt;br&gt;
and like doves to their windows?&lt;br&gt;
For the coastlands shall wait for me,&lt;br&gt;
the ships of Tarshish first,&lt;br&gt;
to bring your children from far away,&lt;br&gt;
their silver and gold with them,&lt;br&gt;
for the name of the Lord your God,&lt;br&gt;
and for the Holy One of Israel,&lt;br&gt;
because he has glorified you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, judicium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Give the King your justice, O God, *&lt;br&gt;
and your righteousness to the King&amp;rsquo;s son;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	That he may rule your people righteously *&lt;br&gt;
and the poor with justice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *&lt;br&gt;
and the little hills bring righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He shall defend the needy among the people; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, *&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to another.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, *&lt;br&gt;
like showers that water the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	In his time shall the righteous flourish; *&lt;br&gt;
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He shall rule from sea to sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and from the River to the ends of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	His foes shall bow down before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and his enemies lick the dust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute, *&lt;br&gt;
and the kings of Arabia and Saba offer gifts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	All kings shall bow down before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the nations do him service.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	For he shall deliver the poor who cries out in distress, *&lt;br&gt;
and the oppressed who has no helper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He shall have pity on the lowly and poor; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall preserve the lives of the needy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, *&lt;br&gt;
and dear shall their blood be in his sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Long may he live!&lt;br&gt;
and may there be given to him gold from Arabia; *&lt;br&gt;
may prayer be made for him always,&lt;br&gt;
and may they bless him all the day long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	May there be abundance of grain on the earth,&lt;br&gt;
growing thick even on the hilltops; *&lt;br&gt;
may its fruit flourish like Lebanon,&lt;br&gt;
and its grain like grass upon the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	May his Name remain for ever&lt;br&gt;
and be established as long as the sun endures; *&lt;br&gt;
may all the nations bless themselves in him and&lt;br&gt;
call him blessed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
who alone does wondrous deeds!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	And blessed be his glorious Name for ever! *&lt;br&gt;
and may all the earth be filled with his glory.&lt;br&gt;
Amen. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&amp;ndash; for surely you have already heard of the commission of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me by the working of his power. Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, &amp;ldquo;Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, &amp;ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;&lt;br&gt;
for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-24&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-25&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-26&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-27&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-28&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-29&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-30&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-31&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-7&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gifts of God for the People of God. Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;br&gt;
For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not rest,&lt;br&gt;
until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.&lt;br&gt;
The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.&lt;br&gt;
You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth. (John testified to him and cried out, &amp;ldquo;This was he of whom I said, &amp;lsquo;He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;) From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father&amp;rsquo;s heart, who has made him known.&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, third, and fourth candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving God, your mercy and compassion endure forever. Open our hearts, that we may receive your love; and following the example of your Son, spread that love to a love-starved world. Through Jesus Christ, who loved us to the end. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sharedprayers.net/images/music/ocome-compact.png&#34; alt=&#34;Veni, veni, Emmanuel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Desire of nations, bind in one the hearts of all mankind;&lt;br&gt;
bid Thou our sad divisions cease, and be Thyself our King of Peace.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrance-hymn-_hark-the-glad-sound_-hymnal-72&#34;&gt;Entrance Hymn: &lt;em&gt;Hark, the glad sound!&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 72)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,&lt;br&gt;
the Savior promised long:&lt;br&gt;
let every heart prepare a throne,&lt;br&gt;
and every voice a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
He comes, the prisoners to release&lt;br&gt;
in Satan&amp;rsquo;s bondage held;&lt;br&gt;
the gates of brass before him burst,&lt;br&gt;
the iron fetters yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
He comes, the broken heart to bind,&lt;br&gt;
the bleeding soul to cure;&lt;br&gt;
and with the treasures of his grace&lt;br&gt;
to enrich the humble poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,&lt;br&gt;
thy welcome shall proclaim;&lt;br&gt;
and heaven&amp;rsquo;s eternal arches ring&lt;br&gt;
with thy beloved Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purify our conscience, Almighty God, by your daily visitation, that your Son Jesus Christ, at his coming, may find in us a mansion prepared for himself; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the king was settled in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, &amp;ldquo;See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent.&amp;rdquo; Nathan said to the king, &amp;ldquo;Go, do all that you have in mind; for the LORD is with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan: Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the LORD: Are you the one to build me a house to live in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent and a tabernacle. Wherever I have moved about among all the people of Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the tribal leaders of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, &amp;ldquo;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&amp;rdquo; Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.&lt;/p&gt;

my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, and third candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, and the third candle is JOY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. (Isaiah 55:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, you came to us in human flesh and you abide with us in the Holy Spirit. Fill us with your joy, and help us shine as a light to the world. Through Jesus Christ, who makes our joy complete. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

make safe the way that leads on high, and close the path to misery.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Day-spring from on high and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me;&lt;br&gt;
he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;&lt;br&gt;
to provide for those who mourn in Zion— to give them a garland instead of ashes,&lt;br&gt;
the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.&lt;br&gt;
They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations;&lt;br&gt;
they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.&lt;br&gt;
For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing;&lt;br&gt;
I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.&lt;br&gt;
Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples;&lt;br&gt;
all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed.&lt;br&gt;
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&lt;br&gt;
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-126&#34;&gt;Psalm 126&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of / Zion, *&lt;br&gt;
then were we like those who / dream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Then was our mouth filled with / laughter, *&lt;br&gt;
and our tongue with shouts of / joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then they said among the / nations, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The LORD has done great things for / them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The LORD has done great things for / us, *&lt;br&gt;
and we are glad in- / deed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Restore our fortunes, O / LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
like the watercourses of the / Negev.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Those who sowed with / tears *&lt;br&gt;
will reap with songs of / joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the / seed, *&lt;br&gt;
will come again with joy, shouldering their / sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise the words of prophets, but test everything; hold fast to what is good; abstain from every form of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’” as the prophet Isaiah said. Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know, the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.” This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, and third candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, and the third candle is JOY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. (Isaiah 55:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, you came to us in human flesh and you abide with us in the Holy Spirit. Fill us with your joy, and help us shine as a light to the world. Through Jesus Christ, who makes our joy complete. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

make safe the way that leads on high, and close the path to misery.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Day-spring from on high and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;&lt;br&gt;
disperse the gloomy clouds of night, and death&amp;rsquo;s dark shadow put to flight.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and, because we are sorely hindered by our sins, let your bountiful grace and mercy speedily help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and glory, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me;&lt;br&gt;
he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;&lt;br&gt;
to provide for those who mourn in Zion— to give them a garland instead of ashes,&lt;br&gt;
the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.&lt;br&gt;
They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations;&lt;br&gt;
they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.&lt;br&gt;
For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing;&lt;br&gt;
I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.&lt;br&gt;
Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples;&lt;br&gt;
all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed.&lt;br&gt;
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&lt;br&gt;
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise the words of prophets, but test everything; hold fast to what is good; abstain from every form of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’” as the prophet Isaiah said. Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know, the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.” This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.&lt;br&gt;
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;br&gt;
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;at-the-following-words-the-celebrant-touches-the-water&#34;&gt;At the following words, the Celebrant touches the water&lt;/h5&gt;

Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and&lt;br&gt;
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;
Christ our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and&lt;br&gt;
glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

Spirit you have bestowed upon these your servants the&lt;br&gt;
forgiveness of sin, and have raised them to the new life of&lt;br&gt;
grace. Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit. Give them&lt;br&gt;
an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to&lt;br&gt;
persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;

Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-36&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.&lt;br&gt;
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her&lt;br&gt;
that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid,&lt;br&gt;
that she has received from the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand double for all her sins.&lt;br&gt;
A voice cries out:&lt;br&gt;
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;br&gt;
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low;&lt;br&gt;
the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.&lt;br&gt;
Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”&lt;br&gt;
A voice says, “Cry out!” And I said, “What shall I cry?”&lt;br&gt;
All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.&lt;br&gt;
Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings;&lt;br&gt;
lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear;&lt;br&gt;
say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”&lt;br&gt;
See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him;&lt;br&gt;
his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.&lt;br&gt;
He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms,&lt;br&gt;
and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire? But, in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish; and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;pb&#34;&gt;pb&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first candle of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-1-2-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 1-2) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sharedprayers.net/images/music/ocome-compact.png&#34; alt=&#34;Veni, veni, Emmanuel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, who orderest all things mightily;&lt;br&gt;
to us the path of knowledge show, and teach us in her ways to go.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spare us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all inordinate and sinful affections; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sinners do beseech thee to hear us, O Lord God; and that it may please thee to rule and govern thy holy Church Universal in the right way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give us a heart to love and fear thee, and diligently to live after thy commandments,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee so to rule the hearts of thy servants, the President of the United States (or of this nation), and all others in authority, that they may do justice, and love mercy, and walk in the ways of truth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to make wars to cease in all the world; to give to all nations unity, peace, and concord; and to bestow freedom upon all peoples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to show thy pity upon all prisoners and captives, the homeless and the hungry, and all who are desolate and oppressed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give and preserve to our use the bountiful fruits of the earth, so that in due time all may enjoy them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to inspire us, in our several callings, to do the work which thou givest us to do with singleness of heart as thy servants, and for the common good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give us true repentance; to forgive us all our sins, negligences, and ignorances; and to endue us with the grace of thy Holy Spirit to amend our lives according to thy holy Word,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!&lt;br&gt;
When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.&lt;br&gt;
From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived,&lt;br&gt;
no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.&lt;br&gt;
You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways.&lt;br&gt;
But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.&lt;br&gt;
We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.&lt;br&gt;
We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&lt;br&gt;
There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you;&lt;br&gt;
for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.&lt;br&gt;
Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.&lt;br&gt;
Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember iniquity forever. Now consider, we are all your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the / cherubim.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Restore us, O God of / hosts; *&lt;br&gt;
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be / saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	O LORD God of / hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your / people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You have fed them with the bread of / tears; *&lt;br&gt;
you have given them bowls of tears to / drink.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made us the derision of our / neighbors, *&lt;br&gt;
and our enemies laugh us to / scorn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Restore us, O God of / hosts; *&lt;br&gt;
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be / saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Let your hand be upon the man of your / right hand, *&lt;br&gt;
and son of man you have made so strong for your- / self.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus, for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind&amp;ndash; just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you&amp;ndash; so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “In those days, after that suffering,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,&lt;br&gt;
and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory. Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. Therefore, keep awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn, or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly. And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?’ And the king will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.’ Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‘You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ Then they also will answer, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not take care of you?’ Then he will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. So the LORD sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Go, take position at Mount Tabor, bringing ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun. I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	So our eyes look to the LORD our / God, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. When they say, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and there will be no escape! But you, beloved, are not in darkness, for that day to surprise you like a thief; for you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness. So then let us not fall asleep as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober; for those who sleep sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him. Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “It is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;em&gt;(Philippians 1:2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bcp-79&#34;&gt;BCP 79&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;confession-of-sin&#34;&gt;Confession of Sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-people-kneel-or-stand-as-able-silence-may-be-kept&#34;&gt;The people kneel or stand as able. Silence may be kept.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-2&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our  sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen. Alleluia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.&lt;br&gt;
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Lord is a great God, *&lt;br&gt;
and a great King above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and the heights of the hills are his also.&lt;br&gt;
The sea is his, for he made it, *&lt;br&gt;
and his hands have molded the dry land.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *&lt;br&gt;
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.&lt;br&gt;
For he is our God,&lt;br&gt;
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Be joyful in God, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
sing the glory of his Name;&lt;br&gt;
sing the glory of his praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Say to God, &amp;ldquo;How awesome are your deeds! *&lt;br&gt;
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	All the earth bows down before you, *&lt;br&gt;
sings to you, sings out your Name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Come now and see the works of God, *&lt;br&gt;
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He turned the sea into dry land,&lt;br&gt;
so that they went through the water on foot, *&lt;br&gt;
and there we rejoiced in him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	In his might he rules for ever;&lt;br&gt;
his eyes keep watch over the nations; *&lt;br&gt;
let no rebel rise up against him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Bless our God, you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
make the voice of his praise to be heard;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Who holds our souls in life, *&lt;br&gt;
and will not allow our feet to slip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For you, O God, have proved us; *&lt;br&gt;
you have tried us just as silver is tried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	You brought us into the snare; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	You let enemies ride over our heads;&lt;br&gt;
we went through fire and water; *&lt;br&gt;
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings&lt;br&gt;
and will pay you my vows, *&lt;br&gt;
which I promised with my lips&lt;br&gt;
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts&lt;br&gt;
with the smoke of rams; *&lt;br&gt;
I will give you oxen and goats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Come and listen, all you who fear God, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will tell you what he has done for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	I called out to him with my mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his praise was on my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	If I had found evil in my heart, *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord would not have heard me;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	But in truth God has heard me; *&lt;br&gt;
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor withheld his love from me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-67&#34;&gt;Psalm 67&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus misereatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	May God be merciful to us and bless us, *&lt;br&gt;
show us the light of his countenance and come to us.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let your ways be known upon earth, *&lt;br&gt;
your saving health among all nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Maccabees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there, they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them. And it was reported to the king’s officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that those who had rejected the king’s command had gone down to the hiding-places in the wilderness. Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day. They said to them, ‘Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live.’ But they said, ‘We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day.’ Then the enemy quickly attacked them. But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding-places, for they said, ‘Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly.’ So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and livestock, to the number of a thousand people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply. And all said to their neighbours: ‘If we all do as our kindred have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth.’ So they made this decision that day: ‘Let us fight against anyone who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our kindred died in their hiding-places.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, all who offered themselves willingly for the law. And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: ‘Arrogance and scorn have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger. Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *&lt;br&gt;
he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;br&gt;
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;br&gt;
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;br&gt;
that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;br&gt;
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;br&gt;
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,&lt;br&gt;
Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,&lt;br&gt;
To give his people knowledge of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;br&gt;
In the tender compassion of our God *&lt;br&gt;
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;br&gt;
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. The believers from there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later he called together the local leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them, ‘Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, yet I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. When they had examined me, the Romans wanted to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to the emperor—even though I had no charge to bring against my nation. For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.’ They replied, ‘We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you. But we would like to hear from you what you think, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they had fixed a day to meet him, they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers. From morning until evening he explained the matter to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are God: we praise you;&lt;br&gt;
You are the Lord: we acclaim you;&lt;br&gt;
You are the eternal Father:&lt;br&gt;
All creation worships you.&lt;br&gt;
To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,&lt;br&gt;
Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise:&lt;br&gt;
Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Father, of majesty unbounded,&lt;br&gt;
your true and only Son, worthy of all worship,&lt;br&gt;
and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You, Christ, are the king of glory,&lt;br&gt;
the eternal Son of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
When you became man to set us free&lt;br&gt;
you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.&lt;br&gt;
You overcame the sting of death&lt;br&gt;
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.&lt;br&gt;
You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.&lt;br&gt;
We believe that you will come and be our judge.&lt;br&gt;
Come then, Lord, and help your people,&lt;br&gt;
bought with the price of your own blood,&lt;br&gt;
and bring us with your saints&lt;br&gt;
to glory everlasting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. So the LORD sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Go, take position at Mount Tabor, bringing ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun. I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. When they say, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and there will be no escape! But you, beloved, are not in darkness, for that day to surprise you like a thief; for you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness. So then let us not fall asleep as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober; for those who sleep sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him. Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “It is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God. And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors—Terah and his sons Abraham and Nahor—lived beyond the Euphrates and served other gods. Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now therefore revere the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. Now if you are unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods; for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight. He protected us along all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed; and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.” And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve the LORD!” Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” He said, “Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.” The people said to Joshua, “The LORD our God we will serve, and him we will obey.” So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died. For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died. For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel&amp;rsquo;s call and with the sound of God&amp;rsquo;s trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ But the wise replied, ‘No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’ And while they went to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. Later the other bridesmaids came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’ Keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you have knit together your elect in one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of your Son Christ our Lord: Give us grace so to follow your blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living, that we may come to those ineffable joys that you have prepared for those who truly love you; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom&lt;br&gt;
and thanksgiving and honor&lt;br&gt;
and power and might&lt;br&gt;
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&amp;rdquo; I said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.&lt;br&gt;
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;&lt;br&gt;
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,&lt;br&gt;
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-341-1022&#34;&gt;Psalm 34:1-10,22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedicam Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will bless the LORD at all / times; *&lt;br&gt;
his praise shall ever be in my / mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	I will glory in the / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let the humble hear and re- / joice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Proclaim with me the greatness of the / LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us exalt his Name to- / gether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I sought the LORD, and he / answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and delivered me out of all my / terror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Look upon him and be / radiant, *&lt;br&gt;
and let not your faces be a- / shamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I called in my affliction and the LORD / heard me *&lt;br&gt;
and saved me from all my / troubles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The angel of the LORD encompasses those who / fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will de- / liver them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Taste and see that the LORD is / good; *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who trust in / him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Fear the LORD, you that are his / saints, *&lt;br&gt;
for those who fear him lack / nothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The young lions lack and suffer / hunger, *&lt;br&gt;
but those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is / good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22	The LORD ransoms the life of his / servants, *&lt;br&gt;
and none will be punished who trust in / him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&amp;rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.&lt;br&gt;
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;br&gt;
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and&lt;br&gt;
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember [&lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt;] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and the LORD showed him the whole land: Gilead as far as Dan, all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, the Negeb, and the Plain—that is, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees—as far as Zoar. The LORD said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.” Then Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, at the LORD’s command. He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day. Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died; his sight was unimpaired and his vigor had not abated. The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the period of mourning for Moses was ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him; and the Israelites obeyed him, doing as the LORD had commanded Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never since has there arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face. He was unequaled for all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants and his entire land, and for all the mighty deeds and all the terrifying displays of power that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-901-613-17&#34;&gt;Psalm 90:1-6,13-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, refugium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Lord, you have been our / refuge *&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to an- / other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Before the mountains were brought forth,&lt;br&gt;
or the land and the earth were / born, *&lt;br&gt;
from age to age you are / God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You turn us back to the dust and / say, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Go back, O child of / earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is / past *&lt;br&gt;
and like a watch in the / night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You sweep us away like a / dream; *&lt;br&gt;
we fade away suddenly like the / grass.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	In the morning it is green and / flourishes; *&lt;br&gt;
in the evening it is dried up and / withered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Return, O LORD; how long will you / tarry? *&lt;br&gt;
be gracious to your / servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the / morning; *&lt;br&gt;
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our / life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Make us glad by the measure of the days that you af- / flicted us *&lt;br&gt;
and the years in which we suffered ad- / versity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Show your servants your / works *&lt;br&gt;
and your splendor to their / children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	May the graciousness of the LORD our God be up- / on us; *&lt;br&gt;
prosper the work of our hands;&lt;br&gt;
prosper our / handiwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain, but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition. For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts. As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed; nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children. So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” He said to him, “’You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question: “What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.” He said to them, “How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet”’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If David thus calls him Lord, how can he be his son?” No one was able to give him an answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said to the LORD, “See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’ Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.” He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” And he said to him, “If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here. For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The LORD’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.” And the LORD continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you, because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to speak about it. For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead&amp;ndash; Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees went and plotted to entrap Jesus in what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?” They answered, “The emperor’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away.&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make gods for us, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” So all the people took off the gold rings from their ears, and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the LORD.” They rose early the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once! Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely; they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’” The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they are. Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make a great nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses implored the LORD his God, and said, “O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’” And the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	That I may see the prosperity of your elect&lt;br&gt;

for the image of an ox that feeds on / grass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	They forgot God their / Savior, *&lt;br&gt;

and fearful things at the Red / Sea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	So he would have destroyed them,&lt;br&gt;
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the / breach, *&lt;br&gt;
to turn away his wrath from con- / suming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. Yes, and I ask you also, my loyal companion, help these women, for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more Jesus spoke to the people in parables, saying: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet, but they would not come. Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited: Look, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding banquet.’ But they made light of it and went away, one to his farm, another to his business, while the rest seized his slaves, mistreated them, and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore into the main streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’ Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ For many are called, but few are chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;

Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God spoke all these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. For six days you shall labour and do all your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not commit adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance, and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caeli enarrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The heavens declare the glory of / God, *&lt;br&gt;
and the firmament shows his / handiwork.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	One day tells its tale to an- / other, *&lt;br&gt;
and one night imparts knowledge to an- / other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	Although they have no words or / language, *&lt;br&gt;
and their voices are not / heard,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into / all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the / world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the / sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its / course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it a- / gain; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning / heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The law of the LORD is perfect&lt;br&gt;
and revives the / soul; *&lt;br&gt;
the testimony of the LORD is sure&lt;br&gt;
and gives wisdom to the / innocent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The statutes of the LORD are just&lt;br&gt;
and rejoice the / heart; *&lt;br&gt;
the commandment of the LORD is clear&lt;br&gt;
and gives light to the / eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The fear of the LORD is clean&lt;br&gt;
and endures for / ever; *&lt;br&gt;
the judgments of the LORD are true&lt;br&gt;
and righteous alto- / gether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine / gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the / comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant en- / lightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great re- / ward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he of/ fends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret / faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion / over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great of- / fense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your / sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my re- / deemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. When the harvest time had come, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.” So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;&lt;br&gt;
this was the Lord’s doing, and it is amazing in our eyes’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom. The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. They wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowds, because they regarded him as a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy, make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death&amp;ndash; even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we are afraid of the crowd; for all regard John as a prophet.” So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ He answered, ‘I will not’; but later he changed his mind and went. The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir’; but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.” So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaining against the LORD. For what are we, that you complain against us?” And Moses said, “When the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the LORD has heard the complaining that you utter against him—what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, ‘Draw near to the LORD, for he has heard your complaining.’“ And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. The LORD spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground. When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;39	He spread out a cloud for a / covering *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;40	They asked, and quails ap- / peared, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;41	He opened the rock, and water / flowed, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;42	For God remembered his holy / word *&lt;br&gt;
and Abraham his / servant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43	So he led forth his people with / gladness, *&lt;br&gt;
his chosen with shouts of / joy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;44	He gave his people the lands of the / nations, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, living is Christ and dying is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which I prefer. I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you. Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith, so that I may share abundantly in your boasting in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you, I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel, and are in no way intimidated by your opponents. For them this is evidence of their destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God&amp;rsquo;s doing. For he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in Christ, but of suffering for him as well&amp;ndash; since you are having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. When he went out about nine o’clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; and he said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went. When he went out again about noon and about three o’clock, he did the same. And about five o’clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, ‘Why are you standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’ When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first.’ When those hired about five o’clock came, each of them received the usual daily wage. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. And when they received it, they grumbled against the landowner, saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’ So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of God who was going before the Israelite army moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and took its place behind them. It came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel. And so the cloud was there with the darkness, and it lit up the night; one did not come near the other all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and the waters were divided. The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left. The Egyptians pursued, and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and chariot drivers. At the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and cloud looked down upon the Egyptian army, and threw the Egyptian army into panic. He clogged their chariot wheels so that they turned with difficulty. The Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot drivers.” So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to its normal depth. As the Egyptians fled before it, the LORD tossed the Egyptians into the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the chariot drivers, the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not one of them remained. But the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great work that the LORD did against the Egyptians. So the people feared the LORD and believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome those who are weak in faith, but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions. Some believe in eating anything, while the weak eat only vegetables. Those who eat must not despise those who abstain, and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat; for God has welcomed them. Who are you to pass judgment on servants of another? It is before their own lord that they stand or fall. And they will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make them stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some judge one day to be better than another, while others judge all days to be alike. Let all be fully convinced in their own minds. Those who observe the day, observe it in honor of the Lord. Also those who eat, eat in honor of the Lord, since they give thanks to God; while those who abstain, abstain in honor of the Lord and give thanks to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not live to ourselves, and we do not die to ourselves. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord&amp;rsquo;s. For to this end Christ died and lived again, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, each of us will be accountable to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter came and said to Jesus, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’ Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’ And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-149&#34;&gt;Psalm 149&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantate Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Sing to the LORD a / new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing his praise in the congregation of the / faithful.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	Let them praise his Name in the / dance; *&lt;br&gt;
let them sing praise to him with timbrel and / harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For the LORD takes pleasure in his / people *&lt;br&gt;
and adorns the poor with / victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Let the faithful rejoice in / triumph; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6	Let the praises of God be in their / throat *&lt;br&gt;
and a two-edged sword in their / hand;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	To wreak vengeance on the / nations *&lt;br&gt;
and punishment on the / peoples;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	To bind their kings in / chains *&lt;br&gt;
and their nobles with links of / iron;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	To inflict on them the judgment de- / creed; *&lt;br&gt;
this is glory for all his faithful people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Halle- / lujah!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-138-14_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 13:8-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not covet”; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &amp;lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&amp;rsquo; and they ask me, &amp;lsquo;What is his name?&amp;rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&amp;rsquo;” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are. Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” No, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.” But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus told his disciples, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done. Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. He said to his people, “Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.” Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built supply cities, Pithom and Rameses, for Pharaoh. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, “When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she shall live.” But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?” The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong. And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every boy that is born to the Hebrews you shall throw into the Nile, but you shall let every girl live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine baby, she hid him three months. When she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him, and plastered it with bitumen and pitch; she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the river. His sister stood at a distance, to see what would happen to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him, “This must be one of the Hebrews’ children,” she said. Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Yes.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed it. When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and she took him as her son. She named him Moses, “because,” she said, “I drew him out of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God&amp;ndash; what is good and acceptable and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another. We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith; ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching; the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph could no longer control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, “Send everyone away from me.” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it. Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me.” And they came closer. He said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide for you there—since there are five more years of famine to come—so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.’ And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my own mouth that speaks to you. You must tell my father how greatly I am honored in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.” Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck. And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecce, quam bonum!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Oh, how good and pleasant it / is, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy. For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Jesus called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand: it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.” Then the disciples approached and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?” He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.” But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles. For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon. Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon.” But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.” He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” He answered, “It is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.” She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob settled in the land where his father had lived as an alien, the land of Canaan. This is the story of the family of Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a helper to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a long robe with sleeves. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” He answered, “Here I am.” So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock; and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came to Shechem, and a man found him wandering in the fields; the man asked him, “What are you seeking?” “I am seeking my brothers,” he said; “tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.” The man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they conspired to kill him. They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild animal has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him” —that he might rescue him out of their hand and restore him to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; and they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balm, and resin, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers agreed. When some Midianite traders passed by, they drew Joseph up, lifting him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Then he called for a famine in the land *&lt;br&gt;
and destroyed the supply of bread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 He sent a man before them, *&lt;br&gt;
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that “the person who does these things will live by them.” But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but by this time the boat, battered by the waves, was far from the land, for the wind was against them. And early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he noticed the strong wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

from dark despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Christ for the world we sing!&lt;br&gt;
The world to Christ we bring&lt;br&gt;
with one accord;&lt;br&gt;
with us the work to share,&lt;br&gt;
with us reproach to dare,&lt;br&gt;
with us the cross to bear,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrance-hymn-_i-come-with-joy_-hymnal-304&#34;&gt;Entrance Hymn: &lt;em&gt;I come with joy&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 304)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
I come with joy to meet my Lord,&lt;br&gt;
forgiven, loved, and free,&lt;br&gt;
in awe and wonder to recall,&lt;br&gt;
his life laid down for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
I come with Christians far and near&lt;br&gt;
to find, as all are fed,&lt;br&gt;
the new community of love&lt;br&gt;
in Christ&amp;rsquo;s communion bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,&lt;br&gt;
each proud division ends.&lt;br&gt;
The love that made us, makes us one,&lt;br&gt;
and strangers now are friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
His presence, always near,&lt;br&gt;
is in such friendship better known,&lt;br&gt;
we see and praise him here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
Together met, together bound,&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ll go our different ways&lt;br&gt;
and as his people in the world,&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ll live and speak his praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regnavit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is King;&lt;br&gt;
let the people tremble; *&lt;br&gt;
he is enthroned upon the cherubim;&lt;br&gt;
let the earth shake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD is great in Zion; *&lt;br&gt;
he is high above all peoples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Let them confess his Name, which is great and awesome; *&lt;br&gt;
he is the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	&amp;ldquo;O mighty King, lover of justice,&lt;br&gt;
you have established equity; *&lt;br&gt;
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God&lt;br&gt;
and fall down before his footstool; *&lt;br&gt;
he is the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,&lt;br&gt;
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *&lt;br&gt;
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; *&lt;br&gt;
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;O LORD our God, you answered them indeed; *&lt;br&gt;
you were a God who forgave them,&lt;br&gt;
yet punished them for their evil deeds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God&lt;br&gt;
and worship him upon his holy hill; *&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD our God is the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-peter-113-21_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Peter 1:13-21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory, since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one&amp;rsquo;s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” —not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah’s eyes were lovely, and Rachel was graceful and beautiful. Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.” So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” So Laban gathered together all the people of the place, and made a feast. But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.) When morning came, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” Laban said, “This is not done in our country—giving the younger before the firstborn. Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.” Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O ruler of the universe, Lord God,&lt;br&gt;
great deeds are they that you have done, *&lt;br&gt;
surpassing human understanding.&lt;br&gt;
Your ways are ways of righteousness and truth, *&lt;br&gt;
O King of all the ages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can fail to do you homage, Lord,&lt;br&gt;
and sing the praises of your Name? *&lt;br&gt;
for you only are the holy One.&lt;br&gt;
All nations will draw near and fall down before you, *&lt;br&gt;
because your just and holy works have been revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God&amp;rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

When you became man to set us free&lt;br&gt;
you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.&lt;br&gt;
You overcame the sting of death&lt;br&gt;
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.&lt;br&gt;
You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.&lt;br&gt;
We believe that you will come and be our judge.&lt;br&gt;
Come then, Lord, and help your people,&lt;br&gt;
bought with the price of your own blood,&lt;br&gt;
and bring us with your saints&lt;br&gt;
to glory everlasting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowds another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; when it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.” And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”&lt;/p&gt;

and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah’s eyes were lovely, and Rachel was graceful and beautiful. Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.” So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” So Laban gathered together all the people of the place, and made a feast. But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.) When morning came, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” Laban said, “This is not done in our country—giving the younger before the firstborn. Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.” Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God&amp;rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowds another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; when it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.” And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You press upon me behind and before *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand upon me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Where can I go then from your Spirit? *&lt;br&gt;
where can I flee from your presence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *&lt;br&gt;
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 If I take the wings of the morning *&lt;br&gt;
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Even there your hand will lead me *&lt;br&gt;
and your right hand hold me fast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 If I say, &amp;ldquo;Surely the darkness will cover me, *&lt;br&gt;
and the light around me turn to night,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Darkness is not dark to you;&lt;br&gt;
the night is as bright as the day; *&lt;br&gt;
darkness and light to you are both alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *&lt;br&gt;
try me and know my restless thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *&lt;br&gt;
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&amp;ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&amp;ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowd another parable: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field; but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well. And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?’ He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he replied, ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;

On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. &lt;em&gt;Amos 5:8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now as we come to the setting of the sun,&lt;br&gt;
and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1391-1122-23&#34;&gt;Psalm 139:1-11,22-23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You press upon me behind and before *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand upon me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Where can I go then from your Spirit? *&lt;br&gt;
where can I flee from your presence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *&lt;br&gt;
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 If I take the wings of the morning *&lt;br&gt;
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Even there your hand will lead me *&lt;br&gt;
and your right hand hold me fast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 If I say, &amp;ldquo;Surely the darkness will cover me, *&lt;br&gt;
and the light around me turn to night,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Darkness is not dark to you;&lt;br&gt;
the night is as bright as the day; *&lt;br&gt;
darkness and light to you are both alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *&lt;br&gt;
try me and know my restless thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *&lt;br&gt;
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-812-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 8:12-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&amp;ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&amp;ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowd another parable: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field; but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well. And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?’ He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he replied, ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived. The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is to be this way, why do I live?” So she went to inquire of the Lord. And the Lord said to her,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided;&lt;br&gt;
the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb. The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!” (Therefore he was called Edom.) Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;105 Your word is a lantern to my feet *&lt;br&gt;
and a light upon my path.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;106 I have sworn and am determined *&lt;br&gt;
to keep your righteous judgments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;107 I am deeply troubled; *&lt;br&gt;
preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;108 Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
and teach me your judgments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;109 My life is always in my hand, *&lt;br&gt;
yet I do not forget your law.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;110 The wicked have set a trap for me, *&lt;br&gt;
but I have not strayed from your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;111 Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
truly, they are the joy of my heart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;112 I have applied my heart to fulfill your statutes *&lt;br&gt;
for ever and to the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&amp;rsquo;s law&amp;ndash; indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. Such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there, while the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hear then the parable of the sower. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet such a person has no root, but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing. But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived. The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is to be this way, why do I live?” So she went to inquire of the Lord. And the Lord said to her,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided;&lt;br&gt;
the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb. The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!” (Therefore he was called Edom.) Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.&lt;/p&gt;

my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&amp;rsquo;s law&amp;ndash; indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. Such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there, while the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hear then the parable of the sower. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet such a person has no root, but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing. But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servant said to Laban, “I am Abraham’s servant. The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys. And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has. My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going! I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,” and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also” —let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son. Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will.” So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes.” Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb. Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming. And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel, and said to the servant, “Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’; the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Jesus said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”&lt;/p&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servant said to Laban, “I am Abraham’s servant. The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys. And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has. My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going! I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,” and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also” —let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son. Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will.” So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes.” Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb. Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming. And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel, and said to the servant, “Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the crowd, “To what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’; the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Jesus said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away. Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you.” Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usquequo, Domine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	How long, O LORD?&lt;br&gt;
will you forget me for ever? *&lt;br&gt;
how long will you hide your face from me?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,&lt;br&gt;
and grief in my heart, day after day? *&lt;br&gt;
how long shall my enemy triumph over me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Look upon me and answer me, O LORD my God; *&lt;br&gt;
give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Lest my enemy say, &amp;ldquo;I have prevailed over him,&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	But I put my trust in your mercy; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart is joyful because of your saving help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I will sing to the LORD, for he has dealt with me richly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. No longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and present your members to God as instruments of righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that you, having once been slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted, and that you, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. So what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the advantage you get is sanctification. The end is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet&amp;rsquo;s reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous; and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple&amp;ndash; truly I tell you, none of these will lose their reward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac.” The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you. As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow. He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve disciples, “A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above the master; it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. And even the hairs of your head are all counted. So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.”&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Keep watch over my life, for I am faithful; *&lt;br&gt;
save your servant who puts his trust in you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

for to you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and great is your love toward all who call upon you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 Turn to me and have mercy upon me; *&lt;br&gt;
give your strength to your servant;&lt;br&gt;
and save the child of your handmaid.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 Show me a sign of your favor,&lt;br&gt;
so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; *&lt;br&gt;
because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac.” The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you. As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow. He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canticle 17: The Song of Simeon&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Nunc Dimittis&lt;/em&gt;  (Luke 2:29-32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-third-lesson-_matthew-1024-39_&#34;&gt;The Third Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Matthew 10:24-39&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve disciples, “A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above the master; it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. And even the hairs of your head are all counted. So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-2&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our  sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter his gates with thanksgiving;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day. He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground. He said, “My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Make ready quickly three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes.” Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said to him, “Where is your wife Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” Then one said, “I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?” The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ Is anything too wonderful for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son.” But Sarah denied, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. He said, “Oh yes, you did laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The LORD dealt with Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as he had promised. Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to his son whom Sarah bore him. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Now Sarah said, “God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would ever have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely, it is God who saves me; *&lt;br&gt;
I will trust in him and not be afraid.&lt;br&gt;
For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will be my Savior.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;br&gt;
And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;br&gt;
Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;br&gt;
Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;br&gt;
Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&amp;rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person&amp;ndash; though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to God in the highest,&lt;br&gt;
and peace to his people on earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord God, heavenly King,&lt;br&gt;

we worship you, we give you thanks,&lt;br&gt;
we praise you for your glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. [Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day. He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground. He said, “My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Make ready quickly three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes.” Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said to him, “Where is your wife Sarah?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” Then one said, “I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?” The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ Is anything too wonderful for the LORD? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son.” But Sarah denied, saying, “I did not laugh”; for she was afraid. He said, “Oh yes, you did laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The LORD dealt with Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as he had promised. Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to his son whom Sarah bore him. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Now Sarah said, “God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” And she said, “Who would ever have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&amp;rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person&amp;ndash; though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. [Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.”]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother’s son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him. From there he moved on to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and invoked the name of the LORD. And Abram journeyed on by stages toward the Negeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-331-12&#34;&gt;Psalm 33:1-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exultate, justi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *&lt;br&gt;
it is good for the just to sing praises.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Praise the LORD with the harp; *&lt;br&gt;
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Sing for him a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 For the word of the LORD is right, *&lt;br&gt;
and all his works are sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 He loves righteousness and justice; *&lt;br&gt;
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, *&lt;br&gt;
by the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin *&lt;br&gt;
and stores up the depths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For he spoke, and it came to pass; *&lt;br&gt;
he commanded, and it stood fast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; *&lt;br&gt;
he thwarts the designs of the peoples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 But the LORD&amp;rsquo;S will stands fast for ever, *&lt;br&gt;
and the designs of his heart from age to age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-413-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 4:13-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.” He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. Therefore his faith “was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he got up and followed him. And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples. Then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak, for she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well.” Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well. When Jesus came to the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, he said, “Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. And the report of this spread throughout that district.&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. &lt;em&gt;Amos 5:8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now as we come to the setting of the sun,&lt;br&gt;
and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *&lt;br&gt;
it is good for the just to sing praises.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Praise the LORD with the harp; *&lt;br&gt;
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Sing for him a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 For the word of the LORD is right, *&lt;br&gt;
and all his works are sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 He loves righteousness and justice; *&lt;br&gt;
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, *&lt;br&gt;
by the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin *&lt;br&gt;
and stores up the depths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For he spoke, and it came to pass; *&lt;br&gt;
he commanded, and it stood fast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; *&lt;br&gt;
he thwarts the designs of the peoples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 But the LORD&amp;rsquo;S will stands fast for ever, *&lt;br&gt;
and the designs of his heart from age to age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother’s son Lot, and all the possessions that they had gathered, and the persons whom they had acquired in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. Then the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him. From there he moved on to the hill country on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and invoked the name of the LORD. And Abram journeyed on by stages toward the Negeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-413-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 4:13-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.” He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. Therefore his faith “was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he got up and followed him. And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples. Then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak, for she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well.” Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well. When Jesus came to the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, he said, “Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. And the report of this spread throughout that district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so. God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.” So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&amp;ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s deeds of power.&amp;rdquo; All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &amp;ldquo;What does this mean?&amp;rdquo; But others sneered and said, &amp;ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In the last days it will be, God declares,&lt;br&gt;
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,&lt;br&gt;
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.&lt;br&gt;
Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&lt;br&gt;
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.&lt;br&gt;
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s great and glorious day.&lt;br&gt;
Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&amp;ndash; Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&amp;ndash; and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,&lt;br&gt;
with all thy quickening powers;&lt;br&gt;
kindle a flame of sacred love&lt;br&gt;
in these cold hearts of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
See how we trifle here below,&lt;br&gt;
fond of these earthly toys:&lt;br&gt;
our souls, how heavily they go,&lt;br&gt;
to reach eternal joys.&lt;/p&gt;

in vain we strive to rise:&lt;br&gt;
hosannas languish on our tongues,&lt;br&gt;
and our devotion dies.&lt;/p&gt;

and that shall kindle ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
We walk by faith, and not by sight;&lt;br&gt;
no gracious words we hear from him&lt;br&gt;
who spoke as none e&amp;rsquo;er spoke;&lt;br&gt;
but we believe him near.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
We may not touch his hands and side,&lt;br&gt;
nor follow where he trod;&lt;br&gt;
but in his promise we rejoice;&lt;br&gt;
and cry, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and God!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;&lt;br&gt;
and may our faith abound,&lt;br&gt;
to call on you when you are near,&lt;br&gt;
and seek where you are found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
that, when our life of faith is done,&lt;br&gt;
in realms of clearer light&lt;br&gt;
we may behold you as you are,&lt;br&gt;
with full and endless sight.&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
Lord, you give the great commission:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Heal the sick and preach the word.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Lest the Church neglect its mission&lt;br&gt;
and the Gospel go unheard,&lt;br&gt;

life abundant meant for each,&lt;br&gt;
give us all new fervor,&lt;br&gt;
draw us closer in community;&lt;br&gt;

Lord, you make the common holy:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;This my body, this my blood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Let your priests, for earth&amp;rsquo;s true glory,&lt;br&gt;
daily lift life heavenward,&lt;br&gt;
asking that world around us&lt;br&gt;
share your children&amp;rsquo;s liberty;&lt;br&gt;

Lord, you show us love&amp;rsquo;s true measure:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Father, what they do, forgive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Yet we hoard as private treasure&lt;br&gt;
all that you so freely give.&lt;br&gt;
May your care and mercy lead us&lt;br&gt;
to a just society;&lt;br&gt;
with the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s gifts empower us&lt;br&gt;
for the work of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
Lord, you bless with words assuring:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I am with you to the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Faith and hope and love restoring,&lt;br&gt;
may we serve as you intend,&lt;br&gt;
and, amid the cares that claim us,&lt;br&gt;
hold in mind eternity;&lt;br&gt;
with the Spirit&amp;rsquo;s gifts empower us&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the apostles had come together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?” He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away. When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exsurgat Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who hate him flee before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *&lt;br&gt;
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *&lt;br&gt;
let them also be merry and joyful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;&lt;br&gt;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, *&lt;br&gt;
God in his holy habitation!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners into freedom; *&lt;br&gt;
but the rebels shall live in dry places.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 O God, when you went forth before your people, *&lt;br&gt;
when you marched through the wilderness,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *&lt;br&gt;
you refreshed the land when it was weary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Your people found their home in it; *&lt;br&gt;
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision for the poor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
sing praises to the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;34 He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 Ascribe power to God; *&lt;br&gt;
his majesty is over Israel;&lt;br&gt;
his strength is in the skies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;36 How wonderful is God in his holy places! *&lt;br&gt;
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his people!&lt;br&gt;
Blessed be God!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christ&amp;rsquo;s sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in your faith, for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering. And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all people, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. So now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything you have given me is from you; for the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established the moon and the sun. You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter. &lt;em&gt;Psalm 74:15, 16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now as we come to the setting of the sun,&lt;br&gt;
and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-681-1033-36&#34;&gt;Psalm 68:1-10,33-36&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exsurgat Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who hate him flee before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *&lt;br&gt;
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *&lt;br&gt;
let them also be merry and joyful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;&lt;br&gt;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, *&lt;br&gt;
God in his holy habitation!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners into freedom; *&lt;br&gt;
but the rebels shall live in dry places.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 O God, when you went forth before your people, *&lt;br&gt;
when you marched through the wilderness,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *&lt;br&gt;
you refreshed the land when it was weary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Your people found their home in it; *&lt;br&gt;
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision for the poor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
sing praises to the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;34 He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 Ascribe power to God; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the apostles had come together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?” He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away. When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christ&amp;rsquo;s sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in your faith, for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering. And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all people, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. So now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything you have given me is from you; for the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things. From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘For we too are his offspring.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 Bless our God, you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
make the voice of his praise to be heard;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Who holds our souls in life, *&lt;br&gt;
and will not allow our feet to slip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For you, O God, have proved us; *&lt;br&gt;
you have tried us just as silver is tried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 You brought us into the snare; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You let enemies ride over our heads;&lt;br&gt;
we went through fire and water; *&lt;br&gt;
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings&lt;br&gt;
and will pay you my vows, *&lt;br&gt;
which I promised with my lips&lt;br&gt;
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts&lt;br&gt;
with the smoke of rams; *&lt;br&gt;
I will give you oxen and goats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will tell you what he has done for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I called out to him with my mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his praise was on my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 If I had found evil in my heart, *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord would not have heard me;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But in truth God has heard me; *&lt;br&gt;
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor withheld his love from me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good? But even if you do suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, and do not be intimidated, but in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and reverence. Keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be God&amp;rsquo;s will, than to suffer for doing evil. For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you&amp;ndash; not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ”If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established the moon and the sun. You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter. &lt;em&gt;Psalm 74:15, 16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O gracious light,&lt;br&gt;
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now as we come to the setting of the sun,&lt;br&gt;
and our eyes behold the vesper light,&lt;br&gt;
we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,&lt;br&gt;
O Son of God, O Giver of Life,&lt;br&gt;
and to be glorified through all the worlds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jubilate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Bless our God, you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
make the voice of his praise to be heard;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Who holds our souls in life, *&lt;br&gt;
and will not allow our feet to slip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For you, O God, have proved us; *&lt;br&gt;
you have tried us just as silver is tried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 You brought us into the snare; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You let enemies ride over our heads;&lt;br&gt;
we went through fire and water; *&lt;br&gt;
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings&lt;br&gt;
and will pay you my vows, *&lt;br&gt;
which I promised with my lips&lt;br&gt;
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts&lt;br&gt;
with the smoke of rams; *&lt;br&gt;
I will give you oxen and goats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will tell you what he has done for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I called out to him with my mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his praise was on my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 If I had found evil in my heart, *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord would not have heard me;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But in truth God has heard me; *&lt;br&gt;
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor withheld his love from me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things. From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘For we too are his offspring.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good? But even if you do suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, and do not be intimidated, but in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and reverence. Keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be God&amp;rsquo;s will, than to suffer for doing evil. For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you&amp;ndash; not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord, you now have set your servant free *&lt;br&gt;
to go in peace as you have promised;&lt;br&gt;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:&lt;br&gt;
A Light to enlighten the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and the glory of your people Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ”If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with the Holy Spirit, Stephen gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. “Look,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-311-515-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 31:1-5,15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Into your hands I commend my spirit, *&lt;br&gt;
for you have redeemed me,&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, O God of truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-peter-22-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Peter 2:2-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation— if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious;&lt;br&gt;
and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A stone that makes them stumble, and a rock that makes them fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people;&lt;br&gt;
once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. And you know the way to the place where I am going.” Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.” Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had been baptized devoted themselves to the apostles&amp;rsquo; teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awe came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles. All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-23&#34;&gt;Psalm 23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regit me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my / shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in / want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green / pastures *&lt;br&gt;
and leads me beside still / waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my / soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s / sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no / evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they / comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who / trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running / over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my / life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for / ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-peter-219-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Peter 2:19-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a credit to you if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly. If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, what credit is that? But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God&amp;rsquo;s approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. For you were going astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sequence-hymn-_god-is-love-let-heaven-adore-him_-hymnal-379&#34;&gt;Sequence Hymn: &lt;em&gt;God is Love, let heaven adore him&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 379)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: let heaven adore him;&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: let earth rejoice;&lt;br&gt;
let creation sing before him,&lt;br&gt;
and exalt him with one voice.&lt;br&gt;
God who laid the earth&amp;rsquo;s foundation,&lt;br&gt;
God who spread the heavens above,&lt;br&gt;
God who breathes through all creation,&lt;br&gt;
God is Love, eternal Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: and love enfolds us,&lt;br&gt;
all the world in one embrace;&lt;br&gt;
with unfailing grasp God holds us&lt;br&gt;
every child of every race.&lt;br&gt;
And when human hearts are breaking&lt;br&gt;
under sorrow&amp;rsquo;s iron rod,&lt;br&gt;
then they find that selfsame aching&lt;br&gt;
deep within the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
God is Love: and though with blindness&lt;br&gt;
sin afflicts all human life,&lt;br&gt;
God&amp;rsquo;s eternal loving-kindness&lt;br&gt;
guides us through our earthly strife.&lt;br&gt;
Sin and death and hell shall never&lt;br&gt;
o&amp;rsquo;er us final triumph gain;&lt;br&gt;
God is Love, so Love for ever&lt;br&gt;
o&amp;rsquo;er the universe must reign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.” Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd, “Let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and to the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.” And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1161-310-17&#34;&gt;Psalm 116:1-3,10-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dilexi, quoniam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *&lt;br&gt;
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 The cords of death entangled me;&lt;br&gt;
the grip of the grave took hold of me; *&lt;br&gt;
I came to grief and sorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Then I called upon the Name of the LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;O LORD, I pray you, save my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 How shall I repay the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
for all the good things he has done for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I will lift up the cup of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Precious in the sight of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
is the death of his servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 O LORD, I am your servant; *&lt;br&gt;
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;&lt;br&gt;
you have freed me from my bonds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you invoke as Father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during the time of your exile. You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish. He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake. Through him you have come to trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are set on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart. You have been born anew, not of perishable but of imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;entrance-hymn-_we-walk-by-faith_-hymnal-209&#34;&gt;Entrance Hymn: &lt;em&gt;We walk by faith&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 209)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
We walk by faith, and not by sight;&lt;br&gt;
no gracious words we hear from him&lt;br&gt;
who spoke as none e&amp;rsquo;er spoke;&lt;br&gt;
but we believe him near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
We may not touch his hands and side,&lt;br&gt;
nor follow where he trod;&lt;br&gt;
but in his promise we rejoice;&lt;br&gt;
and cry, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and God!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;&lt;br&gt;
and may our faith abound,&lt;br&gt;
to call on you when you are near,&lt;br&gt;
and seek where you are found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
that, when our life of faith is done,&lt;br&gt;
in realms of clearer light&lt;br&gt;
we may behold you as you are,&lt;br&gt;
with full and endless sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd, “You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know— this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;&lt;br&gt;
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.&lt;br&gt;
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.&lt;br&gt;
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conserva me, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *&lt;br&gt;
I have said to the LORD, &amp;ldquo;You are my Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my good above all other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *&lt;br&gt;
upon those who are noble among the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 But those who run after other gods *&lt;br&gt;
shall have their troubles multiplied.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Their libations of blood I will not offer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor take the names of their gods upon my lips.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 O LORD, you are my portion and my cup; *&lt;br&gt;
it is you who uphold my lot.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *&lt;br&gt;
indeed, I have a goodly heritage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart teaches me, night after night.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I have set the LORD always before me; *&lt;br&gt;
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *&lt;br&gt;
my body also shall rest in hope.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For you will not abandon me to the grave, *&lt;br&gt;
nor let your holy one see the Pit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You will show me the path of life; *&lt;br&gt;
in your presence there is fullness of joy,&lt;br&gt;
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith&amp;ndash; being more precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by fire&amp;ndash; may be found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy, for you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &amp;ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&amp;rdquo; But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;rdquo; Thomas answered him, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and my God!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand of the LORD came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, “Mortal, can these bones live?” I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.” I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to me, “Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’ Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken and will act,” says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD;&lt;br&gt;
LORD, hear my voice; *&lt;br&gt;
let your ears consider well the voice of my supplication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	If you, LORD, were to note what is done amiss, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, who could stand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For there is forgiveness with you; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore you shall be feared.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I wait for the LORD; my soul waits for him; *&lt;br&gt;
in his word is my hope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	My soul waits for the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
more than watchmen for the morning, *&lt;br&gt;
more than watchmen for the morning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	O Israel, wait for the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
for with the LORD there is mercy;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	With him there is plenteous redemption, *&lt;br&gt;
and he shall redeem Israel from all their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&amp;rsquo;s law&amp;ndash; indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair; her brother Lazarus was ill. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” Accordingly, though Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, after having heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you, and are you going there again?” Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble, because they see the light of this world. But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.” After saying this, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to awaken him.” The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be all right.” Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home. Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.” Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” And when she heard it, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there. When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.” Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.” When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.” Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.” Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is now before the LORD.” But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.” Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.” He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.” Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light— for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true. Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly; but everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man’s eyes, saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?” Some were saying, “It is he.” Others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.” But they kept asking him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ Then I went and washed and received my sight.” They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.” Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And they were divided. So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” He said, “He is a prophet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” He answered, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.” They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?” Then they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” The man answered, “Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?” And they drove him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.” Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he.” He said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped him. Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.” Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, “Surely we are not blind, are we?” Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Come, let us sing to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For the LORD is a great God, *&lt;br&gt;
and a great King above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and the heights of the hills are his also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The sea is his, for he made it, *&lt;br&gt;
and his hands have molded the dry land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *&lt;br&gt;
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For he is our God,&lt;br&gt;
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Harden not your hearts,&lt;br&gt;
as your forebears did in the wilderness, *&lt;br&gt;
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,&lt;br&gt;
when they tempted me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	They put me to the test, *&lt;br&gt;
though they had seen my works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;This people are wayward in their hearts;&lt;br&gt;
they do not know my ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	So I swore in my wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They shall not enter into my rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&amp;rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person&amp;ndash; though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?” Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!” The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?” Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people, “Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?” They left the city and were on their way to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *&lt;br&gt;
from where is my help to come?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	My help comes from the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *&lt;br&gt;
shall neither slumber nor sleep;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The LORD himself watches over you; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the moon by night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; *&lt;br&gt;
it is he who shall keep you safe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *&lt;br&gt;
from this time forth for evermore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then are we to say was gained by Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now to one who works, wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due. But to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly, such faith is reckoned as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.” Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.&lt;/p&gt;

of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give us a heart to love and fear thee, and diligently to live after thy commandments,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee so to rule the hearts of thy servants, the President of the United States (or of this nation), and all others in authority, that they may do justice, and love mercy, and walk in the ways of truth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to make wars to cease in all the world; to give to all nations unity, peace, and concord; and to bestow freedom upon all peoples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to show thy pity upon all prisoners and captives, the homeless and the hungry, and all who are desolate and oppressed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.’“ But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not die; for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *&lt;br&gt;
and whose sin is put away!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *&lt;br&gt;
and in whose spirit there is no guile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *&lt;br&gt;
because of my groaning all day long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *&lt;br&gt;
my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *&lt;br&gt;
and did not conceal my guilt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I said, &amp;ldquo;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	You are my hiding-place;&lt;br&gt;
you preserve me from trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
you surround me with shouts of deliverance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	&amp;ldquo;I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go; *&lt;br&gt;
I will guide you with my eye.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; *&lt;br&gt;
who must be fitted with bit and bridle,&lt;br&gt;
or else they will not stay near you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
but mercy embraces those who trust in the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
shout for joy, all who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned&amp;ndash; sin was indeed in the world before the law, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law. Yet death exercised dominion from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died through the one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, much more surely have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for the many. And the free gift is not like the effect of the one man&amp;rsquo;s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification. If, because of the one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, death exercised dominion through that one, much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore just as one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man&amp;rsquo;s act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. For just as by the one man&amp;rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&amp;rsquo;s obedience the many will be made righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished. The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” But he answered, “It is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will bear you up,&lt;br&gt;
so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels came and waited on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, who before the passion of your only-begotten Son revealed his glory upon the holy mountain: Grant to us that we, beholding by faith the light of his countenance, may be strengthened to bear our cross, and be changed into his likeness from glory to glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there; and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.” So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. To the elders he had said, “Wait here for us, until we come to you again; for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-2&#34;&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quare fremuerunt gentes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *&lt;br&gt;
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,&lt;br&gt;
and the princes plot together, *&lt;br&gt;
against the LORD and against his Anointed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	&amp;ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&amp;rdquo; they say; *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord has them in derision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
and his rage fills them with terror.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	&amp;ldquo;I myself have set my king *&lt;br&gt;
upon my holy hill of Zion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son;&lt;br&gt;
this day have I begotten you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for&lt;br&gt;
your inheritance *&lt;br&gt;
and the ends of the earth for your possession.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	You shall crush them with an iron rod *&lt;br&gt;
and shatter them like a piece of pottery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	And now, you kings, be wise; *&lt;br&gt;
be warned, you rulers of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Submit to the LORD with fear, *&lt;br&gt;
and with trembling bow before him;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Lest he be angry and you perish; *&lt;br&gt;
for his wrath is quickly kindled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Happy are they all *&lt;br&gt;
who take refuge in him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-peter-116-21_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Peter 1:16-21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!” When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.” And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said to all Israel the words which the Lord commanded him, &amp;ldquo;See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity. If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am commanding you today, by loving the LORD your God, walking in his ways, and observing his commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to bow down to other gods and serve them, I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the LORD swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Happy are they whose way is blameless, *&lt;br&gt;
who walk in the law of the LORD!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Happy are they who observe his decrees *&lt;br&gt;
and seek him with all their hearts!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Who never do any wrong, *&lt;br&gt;
but always walk in his ways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You laid down your commandments, *&lt;br&gt;
that we should fully keep them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Oh, that my ways were made so direct *&lt;br&gt;
that I might keep your statutes!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Then I should not be put to shame, *&lt;br&gt;
when I regard all your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I will thank you with an unfeigned heart, *&lt;br&gt;
when I have learned your righteous judgments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I will keep your statutes; *&lt;br&gt;
do not utterly forsake me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but rather as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for solid food. Even now you are still not ready, for you are still of the flesh. For as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving according to human inclinations? For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not merely human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each. I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. The one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose, and each will receive wages according to the labor of each. For we are God’s servants, working together; you are God’s field, God’s building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not murder’; and ‘whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be liable to the council; and if you say, ‘You fool,’ you will be liable to the hell of fire. So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.’ But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let your word be ‘Yes, Yes’ or ‘No, No’; anything more than this comes from the evil one.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set us free, O God, from the bondage of our sins, and give us the liberty of that abundant life which you have made known to us in your Son our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-581-9a9b-12_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 58:1-9a,(9b-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet!&lt;br&gt;
Announce to my people their rebellion, to the house of Jacob their sins.&lt;br&gt;
Yet day after day they seek me and delight to know my ways,&lt;br&gt;
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;&lt;br&gt;
they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.&lt;br&gt;
“Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”&lt;br&gt;
Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers.&lt;br&gt;
Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist.&lt;br&gt;
Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.&lt;br&gt;
Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself?&lt;br&gt;
Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?&lt;br&gt;
Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?&lt;br&gt;
Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke,&lt;br&gt;
to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?&lt;br&gt;
Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house;&lt;br&gt;
when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?&lt;br&gt;
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly;&lt;br&gt;
your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.&lt;br&gt;
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.&lt;br&gt;
[If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,&lt;br&gt;
if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,&lt;br&gt;
then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail.&lt;br&gt;
Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;&lt;br&gt;
you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1121-910&#34;&gt;Psalm 112:1-9,(10)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beatus vir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Happy are they who fear the Lord *&lt;br&gt;
and have great delight in his commandments!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Their descendants will be mighty in the land; *&lt;br&gt;
the generation of the upright will be blessed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Wealth and riches will be in their house, *&lt;br&gt;
and their righteousness will last for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Light shines in the darkness for the upright; *&lt;br&gt;
the righteous are merciful and full of compassion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 It is good for them to be generous in lending *&lt;br&gt;
and to manage their affairs with justice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 For they will never be shaken; *&lt;br&gt;
the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *&lt;br&gt;
their heart is right;&lt;br&gt;
they put their trust in the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Their heart is established and will not shrink, *&lt;br&gt;
until they see their desire upon their enemies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 They have given freely to the poor, *&lt;br&gt;
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;&lt;br&gt;
they will hold up their head with honor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[10 The wicked will see it and be angry;&lt;br&gt;
they will gnash their teeth and pine away; *&lt;br&gt;
the desires of the wicked will perish.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-21-1213-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 2:1-12,(13-16)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish. But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived,&lt;br&gt;
what God has prepared for those who love him”—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. [And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have the mind of Christ.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus, we are all baptized by the one Spirit into one Body and given gifts for a variety of ministries for the common good.  Our purpose is to commission these persons in the name of God and this congregation to the special ministries to which they are called. Are these persons prepared by a commitment to Christ as Lord, by regular attendance and by the knowledge of their duties, to exercise their ministry to the honor of God and the well-being of St. Thomas&amp;rsquo; and the Diocese of New Jersey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presenter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Eternal God, the foundation of all wisdom and the source of all courage: Enlighten with your grace the Wardens and Members of the Vestry of this congregation, and so rule their minds and guide their counsels, that in all things they may seek your glory and promote the mission of your Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Name of God and of this congregation, I commission you as Wardens and Members of the Vestry in this Parish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Micah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear what the LORD says: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.&lt;br&gt;
Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.&lt;br&gt;
“O my people, what have I done to you? In what have I wearied you? Answer me!&lt;br&gt;
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery;&lt;br&gt;
and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.&lt;br&gt;
O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised, what Balaam son of Beor answered him,&lt;br&gt;
and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD.”&lt;br&gt;
“With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high?&lt;br&gt;
Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?&lt;br&gt;
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of rivers of oil?&lt;br&gt;
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”&lt;br&gt;
He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you&lt;br&gt;
but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-15&#34;&gt;Psalm 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, quis habitabit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *&lt;br&gt;
who may abide upon your holy hill?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *&lt;br&gt;
who speaks the truth from his heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	There is no guile upon his tongue;&lt;br&gt;
he does no evil to his friend; *&lt;br&gt;
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *&lt;br&gt;
but he honors those who fear the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He has sworn to do no wrong *&lt;br&gt;
and does not take back his word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *&lt;br&gt;
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Whoever does these things *&lt;br&gt;
shall never be overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-118-31_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 1:18-31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be no gloom for those who were in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;&lt;br&gt;
those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash; on them light has shined.&lt;br&gt;
You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy;&lt;br&gt;
they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;br&gt;
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;

the LORD is the strength of my life;&lt;br&gt;
of whom then shall I be afraid?&lt;br&gt;

one thing I seek; *&lt;br&gt;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days&lt;br&gt;
of my life;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7 For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe&lt;br&gt;
in his shelter; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling&lt;br&gt;
and set me high upon a rock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Even now he lifts up my head *&lt;br&gt;
above my enemies round about me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9 Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation&lt;br&gt;
with sounds of great gladness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will sing and make music to the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on me and answer me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11 You speak in my heart and say, &amp;ldquo;Seek my face.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Your face, LORD, will I seek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Hide not your face from me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 You have been my helper;&lt;br&gt;
cast me not away; *&lt;br&gt;
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose. For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters. What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.” Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee. He left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali, on the road by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—&lt;br&gt;
the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,&lt;br&gt;
and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that time Jesus began to proclaim, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people.&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-491-7_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 49:1-7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands,&lt;br&gt;
pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The Lord called me before I was born,&lt;br&gt;
while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword,&lt;br&gt;
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow,&lt;br&gt;
in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, ‘You are my servant,&lt;br&gt;
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’&lt;br&gt;
But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain,&lt;br&gt;
I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
and my reward with my God.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now the Lord says,&lt;br&gt;
who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him,&lt;br&gt;
and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honoured in the sight of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
and my God has become my strength—&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
‘It is too light a thing that you should be my servant&lt;br&gt;
to raise up the tribes of Jacob&lt;br&gt;
and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations,&lt;br&gt;
that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,&lt;br&gt;
the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
‘Kings shall see and stand up,&lt;br&gt;
princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the Lord, who is faithful,&lt;br&gt;
the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-401-12&#34;&gt;Psalm 40:1-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expectans, expectavi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I waited patiently upon the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he stooped to me and heard my cry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and clay; *&lt;br&gt;
he set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He put a new song in my mouth,&lt;br&gt;
a song of praise to our God; *&lt;br&gt;
many shall see, and stand in awe,&lt;br&gt;
and put their trust in the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are they who trust in the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
they do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God!&lt;br&gt;
how great your wonders and your plans for us! *&lt;br&gt;
there is none who can be compared with you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! *&lt;br&gt;
but they are more than I can count.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure *&lt;br&gt;
(you have given me ears to hear you);&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, *&lt;br&gt;
and so I said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;I love to do your will, O my God;&lt;br&gt;
your law is deep in my heart.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; *&lt;br&gt;
behold, I did not restrain my lips;&lt;br&gt;
and that, O LORD, you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart;&lt;br&gt;
I have spoken of your faithfulness and your deliverance; *&lt;br&gt;
I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the&lt;br&gt;
great congregation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You are the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
do not withhold your compassion from me; *&lt;br&gt;
let your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for ever,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-11-9_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 1:1-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus, for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind&amp;ndash; just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you&amp;ndash; so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

beyond all knowledge and all thought.&lt;/p&gt;

We read thee best in him who came&lt;br&gt;
to bear for us the cross of shame,&lt;br&gt;
sent by the Father from on high,&lt;br&gt;
our life to live, our death to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

We read thy power to bless and save&lt;br&gt;

still more in resurrection light&lt;br&gt;
we read the fullness of thy might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.” And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples, and as he watched Jesus walk by, he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?” He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon. One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed). He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan proclaimed him your beloved Son and anointed him with the Holy Spirit: Grant that all who are baptized into his Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly confess him as Lord and Savior; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-hear-gods-word&#34;&gt;We Hear God&amp;rsquo;s Word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-421-9_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 42:1-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold,&lt;br&gt;
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him;&lt;br&gt;
he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice,&lt;br&gt;
or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break,&lt;br&gt;
and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;&lt;br&gt;
he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed&lt;br&gt;
until he has established justice in the earth;&lt;br&gt;
and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says God, the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who created the heavens and stretched them out,&lt;br&gt;
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it&lt;br&gt;
and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people,&lt;br&gt;
a light to the nations,&lt;br&gt;
to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,&lt;br&gt;
from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name;&lt;br&gt;
my glory I give to no other,&lt;br&gt;
nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass,&lt;br&gt;
and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth,&lt;br&gt;
I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Ascribe to the LORD, you gods, *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.&lt;br&gt;

the LORD is upon the mighty waters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The voice of the LORD is a powerful voice; *&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD is a voice of splendor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedar trees; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *&lt;br&gt;
and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire;&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The voice of the LORD makes the oak trees writhe *&lt;br&gt;
and strips the forests bare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the Israelites: You shall say to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *&lt;br&gt;
your majesty is praised above the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
to quell the enemy and the avenger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *&lt;br&gt;
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you have given your only-begotten Son to take our nature upon him, and to be born [this day] of a pure virgin: Grant that we, who have been born again and made your children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by your Holy Spirit; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with you and the same Spirit be honor and glory, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,&lt;br&gt;
who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, &amp;ldquo;Your God reigns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;&lt;br&gt;
for in plain sight they see the return of the LORD to Zion.&lt;br&gt;
Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations;&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has done marvelous things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	With his right hand and his holy arm *&lt;br&gt;
has he won for himself the victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	The LORD has made known his victory; *&lt;br&gt;
his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Shout with joy to the LORD, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
lift up your voice, rejoice, and sing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Sing to the LORD with the harp, *&lt;br&gt;
with the harp and the voice of song.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	With trumpets and the sound of the horn *&lt;br&gt;
shout with joy before the King, the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Let the sea make a noise and all that is in it, *&lt;br&gt;
the lands and those who dwell therein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Let the rivers clap their hands, *&lt;br&gt;
and let the hills ring out with joy before the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	In righteousness shall he judge the world *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with equity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-11-45-12_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 1:1-4,(5-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&amp;rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to which of the angels did God ever say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let all God&amp;rsquo;s angels worship him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the angels he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the Son he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;&lt;br&gt;
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;&lt;br&gt;
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.&lt;br&gt;
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness&lt;br&gt;
have seen a great light;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
on them light has shined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have multiplied the nation,&lt;br&gt;
you have increased its joy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they rejoice before you&lt;br&gt;
as with joy at the harvest,&lt;br&gt;
as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the yoke of their burden,&lt;br&gt;
and the bar across their shoulders,&lt;br&gt;
the rod of their oppressor,&lt;br&gt;
you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the boots of the tramping warriors&lt;br&gt;
and all the garments rolled in blood&lt;br&gt;
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a child has been born for us,&lt;br&gt;
a son given to us;&lt;br&gt;
authority rests upon his shoulders;&lt;br&gt;
and he is named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,&lt;br&gt;
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His authority shall grow continually,&lt;br&gt;
and there shall be endless peace&lt;br&gt;
for the throne of David and his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will establish and uphold it&lt;br&gt;
with justice and with righteousness&lt;br&gt;
from this time onward and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-96&#34;&gt;Psalm 96&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantate Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *&lt;br&gt;

bring offerings and come into his courts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *&lt;br&gt;
let the whole earth tremble before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Tell it out among the nations: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is King! *&lt;br&gt;
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;&lt;br&gt;
he will judge the peoples with equity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;&lt;br&gt;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *&lt;br&gt;
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy&lt;br&gt;
before the LORD when he comes, *&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He will judge the world with righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with his truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.

&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&amp;ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We praise you and we bless you, holy and gracious God, source of life abundant. From before time you made ready the creation. Your Spirit moved over the deep and brought all things into being: sun, moon, and stars; earth, winds, and waters; and every living thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made us in your image, and taught us to walk in your ways. But we rebelled against you, and wandered far away; and yet, as a mother cares for her children, you would not forget us. Time and again you called us to live in the fullness of your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this day we join with Saints and Angels in the chorus of praise that rings through eternity, lifting our voices to magnify you as we sing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glory and honor and praise to you, holy and living God. To deliver us from the power of sin and death and to reveal the riches of your grace, you looked with favor upon Mary, your willing servant, that she might conceive and bear a son, Jesus the holy child of God. Living among us, Jesus loved us. He broke bread with outcasts and sinners, healed the sick, and proclaimed good news to the poor. He yearned to draw all the world to himself yet we were heedless of his call to walk in love. Then, the time came for him to complete upon the cross the sacrifice of his life, and to be glorified by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, Jesus was at table with his friends. He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As supper was ending, Jesus took the cup of wine. Again, he gave thanks to you, gave it to them, and said: “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is poured out for you and for all for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now gathered at your table, O God of all creation, and remembering Christ, crucified and risen, who was and is and is to come, we offer to you our gifts of bread and wine, 	and ourselves, a living sacrifice. Pour out your Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Body and Blood of Christ. Breathe your Spirit over the whole earth and make us your new creation, the Body of Christ given for the world you have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fullness of time bring us, with blessed Thomas, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, from every tribe and language and people and nation, to feast at the banquet prepared from the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Christ and with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to you be honor, glory, and praise, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, you have caused this holy night to shine with the brightness of the true Light: Grant that we, who have known the mystery of that Light on earth, may also enjoy him perfectly in heaven; where with you and the Holy Spirit he lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness&lt;br&gt;
have seen a great light;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
on them light has shined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have multiplied the nation,&lt;br&gt;
you have increased its joy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they rejoice before you&lt;br&gt;
as with joy at the harvest,&lt;br&gt;
as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the yoke of their burden,&lt;br&gt;
and the bar across their shoulders,&lt;br&gt;
the rod of their oppressor,&lt;br&gt;
you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the boots of the tramping warriors&lt;br&gt;
and all the garments rolled in blood&lt;br&gt;
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a child has been born for us,&lt;br&gt;
a son given to us;&lt;br&gt;
authority rests upon his shoulders;&lt;br&gt;
and he is named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,&lt;br&gt;
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His authority shall grow continually,&lt;br&gt;
and there shall be endless peace&lt;br&gt;
for the throne of David and his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will establish and uphold it&lt;br&gt;
with justice and with righteousness&lt;br&gt;
from this time onward and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-96&#34;&gt;Psalm 96&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantate Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Declare his glory among the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and his wonders among all peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
he is more to be feared than all gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *&lt;br&gt;
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ascribe to the LORD the honor due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
bring offerings and come into his courts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *&lt;br&gt;
let the whole earth tremble before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Tell it out among the nations: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is King! *&lt;br&gt;
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;&lt;br&gt;
he will judge the peoples with equity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;&lt;br&gt;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *&lt;br&gt;
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy&lt;br&gt;
before the LORD when he comes, *&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He will judge the world with righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with his truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Titus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, ‘Do not be afraid; for see—I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.’ And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Glory to God in the highest heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and on earth peace among those whom he favours!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.’ So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God, Light from Light,&lt;br&gt;
true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father;&lt;br&gt;
through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven,&lt;br&gt;
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary&lt;br&gt;
and became truly human.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father,&lt;br&gt;
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,&lt;br&gt;
who has spoken through the prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God our thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We praise you and we bless you, holy and gracious God, source of life abundant. From before time you made ready the creation. Your Spirit moved over the deep and brought all things into being: sun, moon, and stars; earth, winds, and waters; and every living thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made us in your image, and taught us to walk in your ways. But we rebelled against you, and wandered far away; and yet, as a mother cares for her children, you would not forget us. Time and again you called us to live in the fullness of your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this day we join with Saints and Angels in the chorus of praise that rings through eternity, lifting our voices to magnify you as we sing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-130&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-130&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory and honor and praise to you, holy and living God. To deliver us from the power of sin and death and to reveal the riches of your grace, you looked with favor upon Mary, your willing servant, that she might conceive and bear a son, Jesus the holy child of God. Living among us, Jesus loved us. He broke bread with outcasts and sinners, healed the sick, and proclaimed good news to the poor. He yearned to draw all the world to himself yet we were heedless of his call to walk in love. Then, the time came for him to complete upon the cross the sacrifice of his life, and to be glorified by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, Jesus was at table with his friends. He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As supper was ending, Jesus took the cup of wine. Again, he gave thanks to you, gave it to them, and said: “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is poured out for you and for all for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now gathered at your table, O God of all creation, and remembering Christ, crucified and risen, who was and is and is to come, we offer to you our gifts of bread and wine, 	and ourselves, a living sacrifice. Pour out your Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Body and Blood of Christ. Breathe your Spirit over the whole earth and make us your new creation, the Body of Christ given for the world you have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fullness of time bring us, with blessed Thomas, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, from every tribe and language and people and nation, to feast at the banquet prepared from the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Christ and with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to you be honor, glory, and praise, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, third, and fourth candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving God, your mercy and compassion endure forever. Open our hearts, that we may receive your love; and following the example of your Son, spread that love to a love-starved world. Through Jesus Christ, who loved us to the end. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

bid Thou our sad divisions cease, and be Thyself our King of Peace.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel. He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; *&lt;br&gt;
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	O LORD God of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You have fed them with the bread of tears; *&lt;br&gt;
you have given them bowls of tears to drink.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made us the derision of our neighbors, *&lt;br&gt;
and our enemies laugh us to scorn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Restore us, O God of hosts; *&lt;br&gt;
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, *&lt;br&gt;
and son of man you have made so strong for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	And so will we never turn away from you; *&lt;br&gt;
give us life, that we may call upon your Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; *&lt;br&gt;
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name, including yourselves who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all God&amp;rsquo;s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means, “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Come, O Lord, and save us.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;levas-255&#34;&gt;LEVAS 255&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;

as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-18&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first and second candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. (Colossians 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-3-4-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 3-4) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, thou Lord of might, who to Thy tribes on Sinai&amp;rsquo;s height&lt;br&gt;
in ancient times didst give the law, in cloud and majesty and awe.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, thou Branch of Jesse&amp;rsquo;s tree, free them from Satan&amp;rsquo;s tyranny&lt;br&gt;
that trust thy mighty power save, and give them victory o&amp;rsquo;er the grave.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.&lt;br&gt;
The spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
His delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear;&lt;br&gt;
but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid,&lt;br&gt;
the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.&lt;br&gt;
The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.&lt;br&gt;
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder&amp;rsquo;s den.&lt;br&gt;
They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain;&lt;br&gt;
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Give the King your justice, O God, *&lt;br&gt;
and your righteousness to the King&amp;rsquo;s Son;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 That he may rule your people righteously *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *&lt;br&gt;
and the little hills bring righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 He shall defend the needy among the people; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, *&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to another.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, *&lt;br&gt;
like showers that water the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; *&lt;br&gt;
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope. May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again Isaiah says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-130&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-130&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;

      <guid>http://www.sharedprayers.net/archive/2023/first-sunday-of-advent/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;pb&#34;&gt;pb&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first candle of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-1-2-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 1-2) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sharedprayers.net/images/music/ocome-compact.png&#34; alt=&#34;Veni, veni, Emmanuel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, who orderest all things mightily;&lt;br&gt;
to us the path of knowledge show, and teach us in her ways to go.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spare us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all inordinate and sinful affections; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sinners do beseech thee to hear us, O Lord God; and that it may please thee to rule and govern thy holy Church Universal in the right way,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to make wars to cease in all the world; to give to all nations unity, peace, and concord; and to bestow freedom upon all peoples,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to show thy pity upon all prisoners and captives, the homeless and the hungry, and all who are desolate and oppressed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give and preserve to our use the bountiful fruits of the earth, so that in due time all may enjoy them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to inspire us, in our several callings, to do the work which thou givest us to do with singleness of heart as thy servants, and for the common good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In days to come the mountain of the LORD’s house&lt;br&gt;
shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills;&lt;br&gt;
all the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say,&lt;br&gt;
‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;&lt;br&gt;
that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.’&lt;br&gt;
For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples;&lt;br&gt;
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;&lt;br&gt;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.&lt;br&gt;
O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the disciples, “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *&lt;br&gt;
he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight&lt;br&gt;
all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To give his people knowledge of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In the tender compassion of our God *&lt;br&gt;
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-2&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our  sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

You overcame the sting of death&lt;br&gt;
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.&lt;br&gt;
You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.&lt;br&gt;
We believe that you will come and be our judge.&lt;br&gt;
Come then, Lord, and help your people,&lt;br&gt;
bought with the price of your own blood,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;

He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake of your love.&lt;/p&gt;

Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;&lt;br&gt;
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.&lt;br&gt;
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;&lt;br&gt;
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;&lt;br&gt;
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.&lt;br&gt;
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;&lt;br&gt;
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;&lt;br&gt;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;&lt;br&gt;
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&amp;ndash; and their descendants as well.&lt;br&gt;
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&amp;ndash; its food shall be dust!&lt;br&gt;
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, &amp;lsquo;I am he!&amp;rsquo; and, &amp;lsquo;The time is near!&amp;rsquo; Do not go after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray for all those who govern, asking that you turn their hearts and minds to the work of establishing a peace born of justice and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for all those who are caught up in conflict around the globe this day, civilians and peace-keepers and the poor who have no escape, asking that we have the courage to defend the defenseless, make room for those who flee for safety, and look to that day when we will train for war no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the peace you gave us, the peace that passes all human understanding, be the peace that guides and sustains us. For it is in Jesus’ name that we pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &amp;ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing his praise in the congregation of the faithful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; *&lt;br&gt;
let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Let them praise his Name in the dance; *&lt;br&gt;
let them sing praise to him with timbrel and harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For the LORD takes pleasure in his people *&lt;br&gt;
and adorns the poor with victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Let the faithful rejoice in triumph; *&lt;br&gt;
let them be joyful on their beds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Let the praises of God be in their throat *&lt;br&gt;
and a two-edged sword in their hand;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	To wreak vengeance on the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and punishment on the peoples;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	To bind their kings in chains *&lt;br&gt;
and their nobles with links of iron;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	To inflict on them the judgment decreed; *&lt;br&gt;
this is glory for all his faithful people.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&amp;rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;

He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;People:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lift up your hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-18&#34;&gt;People:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-19&#34;&gt;People:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks; for you alone are God, living and true, dwelling in light inaccessible from before time and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember N&amp;hellip;, all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
