&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all things in your well-beloved Son, the King of kings and Lord of lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided and enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together under his most gracious rule; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-100&#34;&gt;Psalm 100&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jubilate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Be joyful in the LORD, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
serve the LORD with gladness&lt;br&gt;
and come before his presence with a song.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Know this: The LORD himself is God; *&lt;br&gt;
he himself has made us, and we are his;&lt;br&gt;
we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Enter his gates with thanksgiving;&lt;br&gt;
go into his courts with praise; *&lt;br&gt;
give thanks to him and call upon his Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For the LORD is good;&lt;br&gt;
his mercy is everlasting; *&lt;br&gt;
and his faithfulness endures from age to age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?’ And the king will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.’ Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‘You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ Then they also will answer, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not take care of you?’ Then he will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. So the LORD sold them into the hand of King Jabin of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and had oppressed the Israelites cruelly twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel. She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, ‘Go, take position at Mount Tabor, bringing ten thousand from the tribe of Naphtali and the tribe of Zebulun. I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the Wadi Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	To you I lift up my eyes, *&lt;br&gt;
to you enthroned in the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, *&lt;br&gt;
and the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	So our eyes look to the LORD our God, *&lt;br&gt;
until he show us his mercy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy, *&lt;br&gt;
for we have had more than enough of contempt,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Too much of the scorn of the indolent rich, *&lt;br&gt;
and of the derision of the proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers and sisters, you do not need to have anything written to you. For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. When they say, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them, as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and there will be no escape! But you, beloved, are not in darkness, for that day to surprise you like a thief; for you are all children of light and children of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness. So then let us not fall asleep as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober; for those who sleep sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him. Therefore encourage one another and build up each other, as indeed you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “It is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them; to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’ Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom&lt;br&gt;
and thanksgiving and honor&lt;br&gt;
and power and might&lt;br&gt;
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&amp;rdquo; I said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.&lt;br&gt;
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;&lt;br&gt;
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,&lt;br&gt;
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-341-1022&#34;&gt;Psalm 34:1-10,22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedicam Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I will bless the LORD at all times; *&lt;br&gt;
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 I will glory in the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let the humble hear and rejoice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us exalt his Name together.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 I sought the LORD, and he answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and delivered me out of all my terror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Look upon him and be radiant, *&lt;br&gt;
and let not your faces be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *&lt;br&gt;
and saved me from all my troubles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will deliver them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Taste and see that the LORD is good; *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who trust in him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Fear the LORD, you that are his saints, *&lt;br&gt;
for those who fear him lack nothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger, *&lt;br&gt;
but those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, *&lt;br&gt;
and none will be punished who trust in him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the first epistle of John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&amp;rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;

He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks; for you alone are God, living and true, dwelling in light inaccessible from before time and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt; all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses. You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’” Joshua then said to the Israelites, “Draw near and hear the words of the LORD your God.” Joshua said, “By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites: the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan. So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people. Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho. While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *&lt;br&gt;
and his mercy endures for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim *&lt;br&gt;
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 He gathered them out of the lands; *&lt;br&gt;
from the east and from the west,&lt;br&gt;
from the north and from the south.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Some wandered in desert wastes; *&lt;br&gt;
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 They were hungry and thirsty; *&lt;br&gt;
their spirits languished within them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *&lt;br&gt;
and he delivered them from their distress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He put their feet on a straight path *&lt;br&gt;
to go to a city where they might dwell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;33 The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *&lt;br&gt;
and water-springs into thirsty ground,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 A fruitful land into salt flats, *&lt;br&gt;
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;35 He changed deserts into pools of water *&lt;br&gt;
and dry land into water-springs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;36 He settled the hungry there, *&lt;br&gt;
and they founded a city to dwell in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;37 They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *&lt;br&gt;
and brought in a fruitful harvest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remember our labor and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was toward you believers. As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children, urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God&amp;rsquo;s word, which is also at work in you believers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses&amp;rsquo; seat; therefore, do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they teach. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long. They love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all students. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father&amp;ndash; the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. All who exalt themselves will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted.”&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and the LORD showed him the whole land: Gilead as far as Dan, all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, the Negeb, and the Plain—that is, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees—as far as Zoar. The LORD said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.” Then Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, at the LORD’s command. He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day. Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died; his sight was unimpaired and his vigor had not abated. The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the period of mourning for Moses was ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him; and the Israelites obeyed him, doing as the LORD had commanded Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never since has there arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face. He was unequaled for all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants and his entire land, and for all the mighty deeds and all the terrifying displays of power that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-901-613-17&#34;&gt;Psalm 90:1-6,13-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, refugium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Lord, you have been our refuge *&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to another.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Before the mountains were brought forth,&lt;br&gt;
or the land and the earth were born, *&lt;br&gt;
from age to age you are God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 You turn us back to the dust and say, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Go back, O child of earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past *&lt;br&gt;
and like a watch in the night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 You sweep us away like a dream; *&lt;br&gt;
we fade away suddenly like the grass.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 In the morning it is green and flourishes; *&lt;br&gt;
in the evening it is dried up and withered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Return, O LORD; how long will you tarry? *&lt;br&gt;
be gracious to your servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; *&lt;br&gt;
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us *&lt;br&gt;
and the years in which we suffered adversity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 Show your servants your works *&lt;br&gt;
and your splendor to their children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 May the graciousness of the LORD our God be upon us; *&lt;br&gt;
prosper the work of our hands;&lt;br&gt;
prosper our handiwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-thessalonians-21-8_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Thessalonians 2:1-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain, but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition. For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts. As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed; nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children. So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” He said to him, “’You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question: “What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.” He said to them, “How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet”’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If David thus calls him Lord, how can he be his son?” No one was able to give him an answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said to the LORD, “See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’ Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.” He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” And he said to him, “If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here. For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The LORD’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.” And the LORD continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.&lt;br&gt;

you were a God who forgave them,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you, because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to speak about it. For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead&amp;ndash; Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees went and plotted to entrap Jesus in what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?” They answered, “The emperor’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make gods for us, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” So all the people took off the gold rings from their ears, and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the LORD.” They rose early the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once! Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely; they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’” The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they are. Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make a great nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses implored the LORD his God, and said, “O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’” And the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *&lt;br&gt;
for his mercy endures for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Who can declare the mighty acts of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
or show forth all his praise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Happy are those who act with justice *&lt;br&gt;
and always do what is right!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have for your people, *&lt;br&gt;
and visit me with your saving help;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 That I may see the prosperity of your elect&lt;br&gt;
and be glad with the gladness of your people, *&lt;br&gt;
that I may glory with your inheritance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 We have sinned as our forebears did; *&lt;br&gt;
we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Israel made a bull-calf at Horeb *&lt;br&gt;
and worshiped a molten image;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20 And so they exchanged their Glory *&lt;br&gt;
for the image of an ox that feeds on grass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 They forgot God their Savior, *&lt;br&gt;
who had done great things in Egypt,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 Wonderful deeds in the land of Ham, *&lt;br&gt;
and fearful things at the Red Sea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 So he would have destroyed them,&lt;br&gt;
had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, *&lt;br&gt;
to turn away his wrath from consuming them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. Yes, and I ask you also, my loyal companion, help these women, for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more Jesus spoke to the people in parables, saying: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding banquet, but they would not come. Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited: Look, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding banquet.’ But they made light of it and went away, one to his farm, another to his business, while the rest seized his slaves, mistreated them, and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore into the main streets, and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’ Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both good and bad; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ For many are called, but few are chosen.”&lt;/p&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God spoke all these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. For six days you shall labour and do all your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not commit adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance, and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caeli enarrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *&lt;br&gt;
and the firmament shows his handiwork.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	One day tells its tale to another, *&lt;br&gt;
and one night imparts knowledge to another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Although they have no words or language, *&lt;br&gt;
and their voices are not heard,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it again; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The law of the LORD is perfect&lt;br&gt;
and revives the soul; *&lt;br&gt;
the testimony of the LORD is sure&lt;br&gt;
and gives wisdom to the innocent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The statutes of the LORD are just&lt;br&gt;
and rejoice the heart; *&lt;br&gt;
the commandment of the LORD is clear&lt;br&gt;
and gives light to the eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The fear of the LORD is clean&lt;br&gt;
and endures for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
the judgments of the LORD are true&lt;br&gt;
and righteous altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he offends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great offense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_philippians-34b-14_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Philippians 3:4b-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. When the harvest time had come, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.” So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;&lt;br&gt;
this was the Lord’s doing, and it is amazing in our eyes’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom. The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. They wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowds, because they regarded him as a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-781-412-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 78:1-4,12-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attendite, popule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Hear my teaching, O my people; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 I will open my mouth in a parable; *&lt;br&gt;
I will declare the mysteries of ancient times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 That which we have heard and known,&lt;br&gt;
and what our forefathers have told us, *&lt;br&gt;
we will not hide from their children.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 We will recount to generations to come&lt;br&gt;
the praiseworthy deeds and the power of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and the wonderful works he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 He worked marvels in the sight of their forefathers, *&lt;br&gt;
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 He split open the sea and let them pass through; *&lt;br&gt;
he made the waters stand up like walls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 He led them with a cloud by day, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the night through with a glow of fire.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 He split the hard rocks in the wilderness *&lt;br&gt;
and gave them drink as from the great deep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 He brought streams out of the cliff, *&lt;br&gt;
and the waters gushed out like rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_philippians-21-13_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Philippians 2:1-13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy, make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death&amp;ndash; even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

never fails from age to age.&lt;/p&gt;

light by night, and shade by day;&lt;br&gt;
safe they feed upon the manna&lt;br&gt;
which he gives them when they pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we are afraid of the crowd; for all regard John as a prophet.” So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ He answered, ‘I will not’; but later he changed his mind and went. The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir’; but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.” So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaining against the LORD. For what are we, that you complain against us?” And Moses said, “When the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the LORD has heard the complaining that you utter against him—what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, ‘Draw near to the LORD, for he has heard your complaining.’“ And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. The LORD spoke to Moses and said, “I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground. When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
make known his deeds among the peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, *&lt;br&gt;
and speak of all his marvelous works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Glory in his holy Name; *&lt;br&gt;
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Search for the LORD and his strength; *&lt;br&gt;
continually seek his face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Remember the marvels he has done, *&lt;br&gt;
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, *&lt;br&gt;
O children of Jacob his chosen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37 He led out his people with silver and gold; *&lt;br&gt;
in all their tribes there was not one that stumbled.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;38 Egypt was glad of their going, *&lt;br&gt;
because they were afraid of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39 He spread out a cloud for a covering *&lt;br&gt;
and a fire to give light in the night season.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;40 They asked, and quails appeared, *&lt;br&gt;
and he satisfied them with bread from heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41 He opened the rock, and water flowed, *&lt;br&gt;
so the river ran in the dry places.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;42. For God remembered his holy word *&lt;br&gt;
and Abraham his servant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43 So he led forth his people with gladness, *&lt;br&gt;
his chosen with shouts of joy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;44 He gave his people the lands of the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
and they took the fruit of others&amp;rsquo; toil,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 That they might keep his statutes *&lt;br&gt;
and observe his laws.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, living is Christ and dying is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which I prefer. I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you. Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith, so that I may share abundantly in your boasting in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you, I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel, and are in no way intimidated by your opponents. For them this is evidence of their destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God&amp;rsquo;s doing. For he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in Christ, but of suffering for him as well&amp;ndash; since you are having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. When he went out about nine o’clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace; and he said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went. When he went out again about noon and about three o’clock, he did the same. And about five o’clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, ‘Why are you standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’ When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first.’ When those hired about five o’clock came, each of them received the usual daily wage. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage. And when they received it, they grumbled against the landowner, saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’ So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angel of God who was going before the Israelite army moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and took its place behind them. It came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel. And so the cloud was there with the darkness, and it lit up the night; one did not come near the other all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The LORD drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and the waters were divided. The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left. The Egyptians pursued, and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and chariot drivers. At the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and cloud looked down upon the Egyptian army, and threw the Egyptian army into panic. He clogged their chariot wheels so that they turned with difficulty. The Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot drivers.” So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to its normal depth. As the Egyptians fled before it, the LORD tossed the Egyptians into the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the chariot drivers, the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not one of them remained. But the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. Israel saw the great work that the LORD did against the Egyptians. So the people feared the LORD and believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.&lt;/p&gt;

the house of Jacob from a people of strange speech,&lt;br&gt;

and the little hills like young sheep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? *&lt;br&gt;
O Jordan, that you turned back?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You mountains, that you skipped like rams? *&lt;br&gt;
you little hills like young sheep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of the God of Jacob,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Who turned the hard rock into a pool of water *&lt;br&gt;
and flint-stone into a flowing spring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome those who are weak in faith, but not for the purpose of quarreling over opinions. Some believe in eating anything, while the weak eat only vegetables. Those who eat must not despise those who abstain, and those who abstain must not pass judgment on those who eat; for God has welcomed them. Who are you to pass judgment on servants of another? It is before their own lord that they stand or fall. And they will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make them stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some judge one day to be better than another, while others judge all days to be alike. Let all be fully convinced in their own minds. Those who observe the day, observe it in honor of the Lord. Also those who eat, eat in honor of the Lord, since they give thanks to God; while those who abstain, abstain in honor of the Lord and give thanks to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not live to ourselves, and we do not die to ourselves. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord&amp;rsquo;s. For to this end Christ died and lived again, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you pass judgment on your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, each of us will be accountable to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter came and said to Jesus, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’ Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’ And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,&lt;br&gt;
how passing thought and fantasy,&lt;br&gt;
that God, the Son of God, should take&lt;br&gt;
our mortal form for mortals&amp;rsquo; sake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
For us baptized, for us he bore&lt;br&gt;
his holy fast and hungered sore;&lt;br&gt;
for us temptations sharp he knew;&lt;br&gt;
for us the tempter overthrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
For us he prayed; for us he taught;&lt;br&gt;
for us his daily works he wrought:&lt;br&gt;
by words and signs and actions, thus&lt;br&gt;
still seeking not himself, but us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
For us to wicked hands betrayed,&lt;br&gt;
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,&lt;br&gt;
he bore the shameful cross and death;&lt;br&gt;
for us gave up his dying breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For us he rose from death again;&lt;br&gt;
for us he went on high to reign;&lt;br&gt;
for us he sent his Spirit here&lt;br&gt;
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
All glory to our Lord and God&lt;br&gt;
for love so deep, so high, so broad;&lt;br&gt;
the Trinity whom we adore&lt;br&gt;
forever and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not covet”; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, truly I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &amp;lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&amp;rsquo; and they ask me, &amp;lsquo;What is his name?&amp;rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&#39;” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
make known his deeds among the peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, *&lt;br&gt;
and speak of all his marvelous works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Glory in his holy Name; *&lt;br&gt;

continually seek his face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Remember the marvels he has done, *&lt;br&gt;
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, *&lt;br&gt;
O children of Jacob his chosen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Israel came into Egypt, *&lt;br&gt;
and Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24 The LORD made his people exceedingly fruitful; *&lt;br&gt;
he made them stronger than their enemies;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, *&lt;br&gt;
and dealt unjustly with his servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26 He sent Moses his servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and Aaron whom he had chosen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are. Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God; for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” No, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.” But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus told his disciples, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done. Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. He said to his people, “Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.” Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built supply cities, Pithom and Rameses, for Pharaoh. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah, “When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she shall live.” But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?” The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong. And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every boy that is born to the Hebrews you shall throw into the Nile, but you shall let every girl live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine baby, she hid him three months. When she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him, and plastered it with bitumen and pitch; she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the river. His sister stood at a distance, to see what would happen to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He was crying, and she took pity on him, “This must be one of the Hebrews’ children,” she said. Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Yes.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed it. When the child grew up, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and she took him as her son. She named him Moses, “because,” she said, “I drew him out of the water.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God&amp;ndash; what is good and acceptable and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another. We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith; ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching; the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you.

Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph could no longer control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, “Send everyone away from me.” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it. Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come closer to me.” And they came closer. He said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children’s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide for you there—since there are five more years of famine to come—so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.’ And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my own mouth that speaks to you. You must tell my father how greatly I am honored in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.” Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck. And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecce, quam bonum!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Oh, how good and pleasant it is, *&lt;br&gt;
when brethren live together in unity!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	It is like fine oil upon the head *&lt;br&gt;
that runs down upon the beard,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Upon the beard of Aaron, *&lt;br&gt;
and runs down upon the collar of his robe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is like the dew of Hermon *&lt;br&gt;
that falls upon the hills of Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	For there the LORD has ordained the blessing: *&lt;br&gt;
life for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy. For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Jesus called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand: it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.” Then the disciples approached and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?” He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.” But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles. For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.”]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon. Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon.” But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.” He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” He answered, “It is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.” She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob settled in the land where his father had lived as an alien, the land of Canaan. This is the story of the family of Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a helper to the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a long robe with sleeves. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” He answered, “Here I am.” So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock; and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came to Shechem, and a man found him wandering in the fields; the man asked him, “What are you seeking?” “I am seeking my brothers,” he said; “tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.” The man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. They saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, they conspired to kill him. They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild animal has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him” —that he might rescue him out of their hand and restore him to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; and they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying gum, balm, and resin, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers agreed. When some Midianite traders passed by, they drew Joseph up, lifting him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the LORD and call upon his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
make known his deeds among the peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, *&lt;br&gt;
and speak of all his marvelous works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Glory in his holy Name; *&lt;br&gt;
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Search for the LORD and his strength; *&lt;br&gt;
continually seek his face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Remember the marvels he has done, *&lt;br&gt;
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, *&lt;br&gt;
O children of Jacob his chosen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Then he called for a famine in the land *&lt;br&gt;
and destroyed the supply of bread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 He sent a man before them, *&lt;br&gt;
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 They bruised his feet in fetters; *&lt;br&gt;
his neck they put in an iron collar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 Until his prediction came to pass, *&lt;br&gt;
the word of the LORD tested him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 The king sent and released him; *&lt;br&gt;
the ruler of the peoples set him free.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 He set him as a master over his household,&lt;br&gt;
as a ruler over all his possessions,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 To instruct his princes according to his will&lt;br&gt;
and to teach his elders wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;45 Hallelujah!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that “the person who does these things will live by them.” But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but by this time the boat, battered by the waves, was far from the land, for the wind was against them. And early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he noticed the strong wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had. Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he struck him on the hip socket; and Jacob&amp;rsquo;s hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Let me go, for the day is breaking.&amp;rdquo; But Jacob said, &amp;ldquo;I will not let you go, unless you bless me.&amp;rdquo; So he said to him, &amp;ldquo;What is your name?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Jacob.&amp;rdquo; Then the man said, &amp;ldquo;You shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with humans, and have prevailed.&amp;rdquo; Then Jacob asked him, &amp;ldquo;Please tell me your name.&amp;rdquo; But he said, &amp;ldquo;Why is it that you ask my name?&amp;rdquo; And there he blessed him. So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, &amp;ldquo;For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved.&amp;rdquo; The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Hear my plea of innocence, O LORD;&lt;br&gt;
give heed to my cry; *&lt;br&gt;
listen to my prayer, which does not come from lying lips.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let my vindication come forth from your presence; *&lt;br&gt;

I have heeded the words of your lips.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 My footsteps hold fast to the ways of your law; *&lt;br&gt;
in your paths my feet shall not stumble.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I call upon you, O God, for you will answer me; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and hear my words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Show me your marvelous loving-kindness, *&lt;br&gt;
O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand&lt;br&gt;
from those who rise up against them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 But at my vindication I shall see your face; *&lt;br&gt;
when I awake, I shall be satisfied, beholding&lt;br&gt;
your likeness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am speaking the truth in Christ&amp;ndash; I am not lying; my conscience confirms it by the Holy Spirit&amp;ndash; I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people, my kindred according to the flesh. They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever.

&lt;p&gt;Jesus withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them and cured their sick. When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is now late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” Jesus said to them, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.” They replied, “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.” And he said, “Bring them here to me.” Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah’s eyes were lovely, and Rachel was graceful and beautiful. Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.” So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” So Laban gathered together all the people of the place, and made a feast. But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her maid.) When morning came, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” Laban said, “This is not done in our country—giving the younger before the firstborn. Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.” Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 The covenant he made with Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God&amp;rsquo;s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowds another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind; when it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you understood all this?” They answered, “Yes.” And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1391-1122-23&#34;&gt;Psalm 139:1-11,22-23&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You press upon me behind and before *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand upon me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Where can I go then from your Spirit? *&lt;br&gt;
where can I flee from your presence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *&lt;br&gt;
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 If I take the wings of the morning *&lt;br&gt;
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Even there your hand will lead me *&lt;br&gt;
and your right hand hold me fast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 If I say, &amp;ldquo;Surely the darkness will cover me, *&lt;br&gt;
and the light around me turn to night,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Darkness is not dark to you;&lt;br&gt;
the night is as bright as the day; *&lt;br&gt;
darkness and light to you are both alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *&lt;br&gt;
try me and know my restless thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *&lt;br&gt;
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-812-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 8:12-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&amp;ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&amp;ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus put before the crowd another parable: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field; but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well. And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?’ He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he replied, ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean. Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived. The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is to be this way, why do I live?” So she went to inquire of the Lord. And the Lord said to her,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided;&lt;br&gt;
the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb. The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!” (Therefore he was called Edom.) Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.” Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;105 Your word is a lantern to my feet *&lt;br&gt;
and a light upon my path.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;106 I have sworn and am determined *&lt;br&gt;
to keep your righteous judgments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;107 I am deeply troubled; *&lt;br&gt;
preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;108 Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
and teach me your judgments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;109 My life is always in my hand, *&lt;br&gt;
yet I do not forget your law.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;110 The wicked have set a trap for me, *&lt;br&gt;
but I have not strayed from your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;111 Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
truly, they are the joy of my heart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;112 I have applied my heart to fulfill your statutes *&lt;br&gt;
for ever and to the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&amp;rsquo;s law&amp;ndash; indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. Such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there, while the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Let anyone with ears listen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hear then the parable of the sower. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what was sown on the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet such a person has no root, but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing. But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”&lt;/p&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servant said to Laban, “I am Abraham’s servant. The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys. And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has. My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going! I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes out to draw, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,” and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also” —let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water jar on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to obtain the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son. Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will.” So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads; may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes.” Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb. Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming. And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel, and said to the servant, “Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the crowd, “To what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to one another,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed, and you did not mourn.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’; the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time Jesus said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and set out and went to the place in the distance that God had shown him. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place far away. Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you.” Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order. He bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” And Abraham looked up and saw a ram, caught in a thicket by its horns. Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usquequo, Domine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 How long, O LORD?&lt;br&gt;
will you forget me for ever? *&lt;br&gt;
how long will you hide your face from me?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,&lt;br&gt;
and grief in my heart, day after day?&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;br&gt;
how long shall my enemy triumph over me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Look upon me and answer me, O LORD my God; *&lt;br&gt;
give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Lest my enemy say, &amp;ldquo;I have prevailed over him,&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 But I put my trust in your mercy; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart is joyful because of your saving help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I will sing to the LORD, for he has dealt with me richly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-612-23_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 6:12-23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions. No longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and present your members to God as instruments of righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that you, having once been slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted, and that you, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. So what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed? The end of those things is death. But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the advantage you get is sanctification. The end is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac.” The matter was very distressing to Abraham on account of his son. But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed because of the boy and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be named for you. As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a nation of him also, because he is your offspring.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, “Do not let me look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the boy; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid; for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. Come, lift up the boy and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make a great nation of him.” Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was with the boy, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow. He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclina, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Bow down your ear, O LORD, and answer me, *&lt;br&gt;
for I am poor and in misery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Keep watch over my life, for I am faithful; *&lt;br&gt;
save your servant who puts his trust in you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be merciful to me, O LORD, for you are my God; *&lt;br&gt;
I call upon you all the day long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Gladden the soul of your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
for to you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 For you, O LORD, are good and forgiving, *&lt;br&gt;
and great is your love toward all who call upon you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;
and attend to the voice of my supplications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon you, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will answer me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Among the gods there is none like you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
nor anything like your works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 All nations you have made will come and worship you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and glorify your Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For you are great;&lt;br&gt;
you do wondrous things; *&lt;br&gt;
and you alone are God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Turn to me and have mercy upon me; *&lt;br&gt;
give your strength to your servant;&lt;br&gt;
and save the child of your handmaid.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 Show me a sign of your favor,&lt;br&gt;
so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; *&lt;br&gt;
because you, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve disciples, “A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above the master; it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. And even the hairs of your head are all counted. So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven; but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so. God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.” So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&amp;ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s deeds of power.&amp;rdquo; All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &amp;ldquo;What does this mean?&amp;rdquo; But others sneered and said, &amp;ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In the last days it will be, God declares,&lt;br&gt;
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,&lt;br&gt;
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.&lt;br&gt;
Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&lt;br&gt;
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.&lt;br&gt;
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s great and glorious day.&lt;br&gt;
Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-10425-3537&#34;&gt;Psalm 104:25-35,37&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedic, anima mea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	O LORD, how manifold are your &lt;strong&gt;works!&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
in wisdom you have made them all;&lt;br&gt;
the earth is full of your &lt;strong&gt;creatures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
26	Yonder is the great and wide sea&lt;br&gt;
with its living things too many to &lt;strong&gt;number,&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
creatures both small and &lt;strong&gt;great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	There move the ships,&lt;br&gt;
and there is that Lev - &lt;strong&gt;iathan,&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
which you have made for the &lt;strong&gt;sport of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
28	All of them look to **you ***&lt;br&gt;
to give them their food in due &lt;strong&gt;season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	You give it to them; they &lt;strong&gt;gather it;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
you open your hand, and they are filled with good &lt;strong&gt;things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
30	You hide your face, and they are &lt;strong&gt;terrified;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
you take away their breath,&lt;br&gt;
and they die and return to their &lt;strong&gt;dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are cre - &lt;strong&gt;ated;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
and so you renew the face of the &lt;strong&gt;earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
32	May the glory of the LORD endure for &lt;strong&gt;ever;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
may the LORD rejoice in all his &lt;strong&gt;works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33	He looks at the earth and it &lt;strong&gt;trembles;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
he touches the mountains and they &lt;strong&gt;smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I &lt;strong&gt;live;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
I will praise my God while I have my &lt;strong&gt;being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35	May these words of mine &lt;strong&gt;please him;&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in the &lt;strong&gt;LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
37	Bless the LORD, O my &lt;strong&gt;soul.&lt;/strong&gt; *&lt;br&gt;
Halle - &lt;strong&gt;lujah!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&amp;ndash; Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&amp;ndash; and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
Come down, O Love divine,&lt;br&gt;
seek thou this soul of mine,&lt;br&gt;
and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;&lt;br&gt;
O Comforter, draw near,&lt;br&gt;
within my heart appear,&lt;br&gt;
and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
O let it freely burn,&lt;br&gt;
till earthly passions turn&lt;br&gt;
to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;&lt;br&gt;
and let thy glorious light&lt;br&gt;
shine ever on my sight,&lt;br&gt;
and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
And so the yearning strong,&lt;br&gt;
with which the soul will long,&lt;br&gt;
shall far outpass the power of human telling;&lt;br&gt;
for none can guess its grace,&lt;br&gt;
till Love create a place&lt;br&gt;
wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the apostles had come together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?” He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away. When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who hate him flee before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let them vanish like smoke when the wind drives it away; *&lt;br&gt;
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; *&lt;br&gt;
let them also be merry and joyful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Sing to God, sing praises to his Name;&lt;br&gt;
exalt him who rides upon the heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
YAHWEH is his Name, rejoice before him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, *&lt;br&gt;
God in his holy habitation!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners into freedom; *&lt;br&gt;
but the rebels shall live in dry places.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 O God, when you went forth before your people, *&lt;br&gt;
when you marched through the wilderness,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain,&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Sinai, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of God, the God of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; *&lt;br&gt;
you refreshed the land when it was weary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Your people found their home in it; *&lt;br&gt;
in your goodness, O God, you have made provision for the poor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
sing praises to the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;34 He rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; *&lt;br&gt;
he sends forth his voice, his mighty voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 Ascribe power to God; *&lt;br&gt;
his majesty is over Israel;&lt;br&gt;
his strength is in the skies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;36 How wonderful is God in his holy places! *&lt;br&gt;
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his people!&lt;br&gt;
Blessed be God!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christ&amp;rsquo;s sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. Resist him, steadfast in your faith, for you know that your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering. And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you. To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all people, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. So now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had in your presence before the world existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything you have given me is from you; for the words that you gave to me I have given to them, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am asking on their behalf; I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave me, because they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I have been glorified in them. And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are one.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, you have prepared for those who love you such good things as surpass our understanding: Pour into our hearts such love towards you, that we, loving you in all things and above all things, may obtain your promises, which exceed all that we can desire; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things. From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘For we too are his offspring.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jubilate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Bless our God, you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
make the voice of his praise to be heard;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Who holds our souls in life, *&lt;br&gt;
and will not allow our feet to slip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For you, O God, have proved us; *&lt;br&gt;
you have tried us just as silver is tried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 You brought us into the snare; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You let enemies ride over our heads;&lt;br&gt;
we went through fire and water; *&lt;br&gt;
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings&lt;br&gt;
and will pay you my vows, *&lt;br&gt;
which I promised with my lips&lt;br&gt;
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts&lt;br&gt;
with the smoke of rams; *&lt;br&gt;
I will give you oxen and goats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will tell you what he has done for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I called out to him with my mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his praise was on my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 If I had found evil in my heart, *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord would not have heard me;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 But in truth God has heard me; *&lt;br&gt;
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor withheld his love from me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good? But even if you do suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, and do not be intimidated, but in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and reverence. Keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who abuse you for your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be God&amp;rsquo;s will, than to suffer for doing evil. For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you&amp;ndash; not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ”If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with the Holy Spirit, Stephen gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. “Look,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-311-515-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 31:1-5,15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Into your hands I commend my spirit, *&lt;br&gt;
for you have redeemed me,&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, O God of truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-peter-22-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Peter 2:2-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation— if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in scripture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious;&lt;br&gt;
and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner”,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A stone that makes them stumble, and a rock that makes them fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people;&lt;br&gt;
once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
In Christ there is no East or West,&lt;br&gt;
in him no South or North,&lt;br&gt;
but one great fellowship of love&lt;br&gt;
throughout the whole wide earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
Join hands, disciples of the faith,&lt;br&gt;
whate&amp;rsquo;er your race may be!&lt;br&gt;
Who serves my Father as his child&lt;br&gt;
is surely kin to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
In Christ now meet both East and West,&lt;br&gt;
in him meet South and North,&lt;br&gt;
all Christly souls are one in him,&lt;br&gt;
throughout the whole wide earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. And you know the way to the place where I am going.” Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.” Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
I come with joy to meet my Lord,&lt;br&gt;
forgiven, loved, and free,&lt;br&gt;
in awe and wonder to recall,&lt;br&gt;
his life laid down for me.&lt;/p&gt;

I come with Christians far and near&lt;br&gt;
to find, as all are fed,&lt;br&gt;
the new community of love&lt;br&gt;
in Christ&amp;rsquo;s communion bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,&lt;br&gt;
each proud division ends.&lt;br&gt;
The love that made us, makes us one,&lt;br&gt;
and strangers now are friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
His presence, always near,&lt;br&gt;
is in such friendship better known,&lt;br&gt;
we see and praise him here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
Together met, together bound,&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ll go our different ways&lt;br&gt;
and as his people in the world,&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ll live and speak his praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had been baptized devoted themselves to the apostles&amp;rsquo; teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awe came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles. All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regit me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *&lt;br&gt;
and leads me beside still waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-peter-219-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Peter 2:19-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a credit to you if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly. If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, what credit is that? But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God&amp;rsquo;s approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. For you were going astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.” Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd, “Let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and to the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.” And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *&lt;br&gt;
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 The cords of death entangled me;&lt;br&gt;
the grip of the grave took hold of me; *&lt;br&gt;
I came to grief and sorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Then I called upon the Name of the LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;O LORD, I pray you, save my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 How shall I repay the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
for all the good things he has done for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I will lift up the cup of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Precious in the sight of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
is the death of his servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 O LORD, I am your servant; *&lt;br&gt;
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;&lt;br&gt;
you have freed me from my bonds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 In the courts of the LORD&amp;rsquo;S house, *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you invoke as Father the one who judges all people impartially according to their deeds, live in reverent fear during the time of your exile. You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish. He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of the ages for your sake. Through him you have come to trust in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are set on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart. You have been born anew, not of perishable but of imperishable seed, through the living and enduring word of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;

and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd, “You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know— this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;&lt;br&gt;
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.&lt;br&gt;
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.&lt;br&gt;
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conserva me, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *&lt;br&gt;
I have said to the LORD, &amp;ldquo;You are my Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my good above all other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *&lt;br&gt;
upon those who are noble among the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 But those who run after other gods *&lt;br&gt;
shall have their troubles multiplied.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Their libations of blood I will not offer, *&lt;br&gt;
nor take the names of their gods upon my lips.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 O LORD, you are my portion and my cup; *&lt;br&gt;
it is you who uphold my lot.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *&lt;br&gt;
indeed, I have a goodly heritage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart teaches me, night after night.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I have set the LORD always before me; *&lt;br&gt;
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *&lt;br&gt;
my body also shall rest in hope.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For you will not abandon me to the grave, *&lt;br&gt;
nor let your holy one see the Pit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You will show me the path of life; *&lt;br&gt;
in your presence there is fullness of joy,&lt;br&gt;
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith&amp;ndash; being more precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by fire&amp;ndash; may be found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy, for you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &amp;ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&amp;rdquo; But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;rdquo; Thomas answered him, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and my God!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand of the LORD came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. He led me all around them; there were very many lying in the valley, and they were very dry. He said to me, “Mortal, can these bones live?” I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them: O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews on you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I prophesied as I had been commanded; and as I prophesied, suddenly there was a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, mortal, and say to the breath: Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.” I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood on their feet, a vast multitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to me, “Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’ Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: I am going to open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you back to the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you on your own soil; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken and will act,” says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD;&lt;br&gt;
LORD, hear my voice; *&lt;br&gt;
let your ears consider well the voice of my supplication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	If you, LORD, were to note what is done amiss, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, who could stand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For there is forgiveness with you; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore you shall be feared.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I wait for the LORD; my soul waits for him; *&lt;br&gt;
in his word is my hope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	My soul waits for the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
more than watchmen for the morning, *&lt;br&gt;
more than watchmen for the morning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	O Israel, wait for the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
for with the LORD there is mercy;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	With him there is plenteous redemption, *&lt;br&gt;
and he shall redeem Israel from all their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&amp;rsquo;s law&amp;ndash; indeed it cannot, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit that dwells in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair; her brother Lazarus was ill. So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” Accordingly, though Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, after having heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you, and are you going there again?” Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Those who walk during the day do not stumble, because they see the light of this world. But those who walk at night stumble, because the light is not in them.” After saying this, he told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to awaken him.” The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will be all right.” Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was referring merely to sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. For your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home. Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.” Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” And when she heard it, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there. When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.” Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.” When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.” Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.” Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is now before the LORD.” But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.” Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.” Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.” He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.” Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light— for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true. Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly; but everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sleeper, awake! Rise from the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and Christ will shine on you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man’s eyes, saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar began to ask, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?” Some were saying, “It is he.” Others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.” But they kept asking him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ Then I went and washed and received my sight.” They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. Then the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes. Then I washed, and now I see.” Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not observe the sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And they were divided. So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” He said, “He is a prophet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but we do not know how it is that now he sees, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.” He answered, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.” They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?” Then they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” The man answered, “Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” They answered him, “You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?” And they drove him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus heard that they had driven him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.” Jesus said to him, “You have seen him, and the one speaking with you is he.” He said, “Lord, I believe.” And he worshiped him. Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see, and those who do see may become blind.” Some of the Pharisees near him heard this and said to him, “Surely we are not blind, are we?” Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now that you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Come, let us sing to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For the LORD is a great God, *&lt;br&gt;
and a great King above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and the heights of the hills are his also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The sea is his, for he made it, *&lt;br&gt;
and his hands have molded the dry land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *&lt;br&gt;
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For he is our God,&lt;br&gt;

Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Harden not your hearts,&lt;br&gt;
as your forebears did in the wilderness, *&lt;br&gt;
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,&lt;br&gt;
when they tempted me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	They put me to the test, *&lt;br&gt;
though they had seen my works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;This people are wayward in their hearts;&lt;br&gt;
they do not know my ways.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	So I swore in my wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They shall not enter into my rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&amp;rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person&amp;ndash; though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?” Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!” The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?” Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people, “Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?” They left the city and were on their way to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

the glorious sun&amp;rsquo;s life-giving ray,&lt;br&gt;
the whiteness of the moon at even,&lt;br&gt;
the flashing of the lightning free,&lt;br&gt;
the whirling wind&amp;rsquo;s tempestuous shocks,&lt;br&gt;
the stable earth, the deep salt sea,&lt;br&gt;
around the old eternal rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
I bind unto myself today&lt;br&gt;
the power of God to hold and lead,&lt;br&gt;
his eye to watch, his might to stay,&lt;br&gt;
his ear to hearken, to my need;&lt;br&gt;
the wisdom of my God to teach,&lt;br&gt;
his hand to guide, his shield to ward;&lt;br&gt;
the word of God to give me speech,&lt;br&gt;
his heavenly host to be my guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
Christ be with me, Christ within me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ behind me, Christ before me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ to comfort and restore me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,&lt;br&gt;
Christ in hearts of all that love me,&lt;br&gt;
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;br&gt;
I bind unto myself the Name,&lt;br&gt;
the strong Name of the Trinity,&lt;br&gt;
by invocation of the same,&lt;br&gt;
the Three in One, and One in Three.&lt;br&gt;
Of whom all nature hath creation,&lt;br&gt;
eternal Father, Spirit, Word:&lt;br&gt;
praise to the Lord of my salvation,&lt;br&gt;
salvation is of Christ the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, whose glory it is always to have mercy: Be gracious to all who have gone astray from your ways, and bring them again with penitent hearts and steadfast faith to embrace and hold fast the unchangeable truth of your Word, Jesus Christ your Son; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse; and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Abram went, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *&lt;br&gt;
from where is my help to come?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	My help comes from the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
the maker of heaven and earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He will not let your foot be moved *&lt;br&gt;
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *&lt;br&gt;
shall neither slumber nor sleep;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The LORD himself watches over you; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is your shade at your right hand,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the moon by night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; *&lt;br&gt;
it is he who shall keep you safe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *&lt;br&gt;
from this time forth for evermore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-41-513-17_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 4:1-5,13-17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then are we to say was gained by Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now to one who works, wages are not reckoned as a gift but as something due. But to one who without works trusts him who justifies the ungodly, such faith is reckoned as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.” Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-14&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die.’“ But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not die; for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *&lt;br&gt;
and whose sin is put away!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *&lt;br&gt;
because of my groaning all day long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *&lt;br&gt;
my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *&lt;br&gt;
and did not conceal my guilt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I said, &amp;ldquo;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;8	You are my hiding-place;&lt;br&gt;
you preserve me from trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
you surround me with shouts of deliverance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I will guide you with my eye.&lt;br&gt;

who must be fitted with bit and bridle,&lt;br&gt;
or else they will not stay near you.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12	Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned&amp;ndash; sin was indeed in the world before the law, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law. Yet death exercised dominion from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died through the one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, much more surely have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for the many. And the free gift is not like the effect of the one man&amp;rsquo;s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification. If, because of the one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass, death exercised dominion through that one, much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore just as one man&amp;rsquo;s trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man&amp;rsquo;s act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. For just as by the one man&amp;rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&amp;rsquo;s obedience the many will be made righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished. The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” But he answered, “It is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will bear you up,&lt;br&gt;
so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels came and waited on him.&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there; and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.” So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. To the elders he had said, “Wait here for us, until we come to you again; for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-2&#34;&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quare fremuerunt gentes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *&lt;br&gt;
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,&lt;br&gt;
and the princes plot together, *&lt;br&gt;
against the LORD and against his Anointed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	&amp;ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&amp;rdquo; they say; *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord has them in derision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
and his rage fills them with terror.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	&amp;ldquo;I myself have set my king *&lt;br&gt;
upon my holy hill of Zion.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son;&lt;br&gt;
this day have I begotten you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for&lt;br&gt;
your inheritance *&lt;br&gt;
and the ends of the earth for your possession.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	You shall crush them with an iron rod *&lt;br&gt;
and shatter them like a piece of pottery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	And now, you kings, be wise; *&lt;br&gt;
be warned, you rulers of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Submit to the LORD with fear, *&lt;br&gt;
and with trembling bow before him;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Lest he be angry and you perish; *&lt;br&gt;
for his wrath is quickly kindled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Happy are they all *&lt;br&gt;
who take refuge in him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-peter-116-21_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Peter 1:16-21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!” When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.” And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said to all Israel the words which the Lord commanded him, &amp;ldquo;See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity. If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am commanding you today, by loving the LORD your God, walking in his ways, and observing his commandments, decrees, and ordinances, then you shall live and become numerous, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you do not hear, but are led astray to bow down to other gods and serve them, I declare to you today that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the LORD swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1191-8&#34;&gt;Psalm 119:1-8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beati immaculati&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Happy are they whose way is blameless, *&lt;br&gt;
who walk in the law of the LORD!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Happy are they who observe his decrees *&lt;br&gt;
and seek him with all their hearts!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Who never do any wrong, *&lt;br&gt;
but always walk in his ways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You laid down your commandments, *&lt;br&gt;
that we should fully keep them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Oh, that my ways were made so direct *&lt;br&gt;
that I might keep your statutes!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Then I should not be put to shame, *&lt;br&gt;
when I regard all your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I will thank you with an unfeigned heart, *&lt;br&gt;
when I have learned your righteous judgments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I will keep your statutes; *&lt;br&gt;
do not utterly forsake me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but rather as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for solid food. Even now you are still not ready, for you are still of the flesh. For as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving according to human inclinations? For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” are you not merely human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each. I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. The one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose, and each will receive wages according to the labor of each. For we are God’s servants, working together; you are God’s field, God’s building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not murder’; and ‘whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment; and if you insult a brother or sister, you will be liable to the council; and if you say, ‘You fool,’ you will be liable to the hell of fire. So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.’ But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let your word be ‘Yes, Yes’ or ‘No, No’; anything more than this comes from the evil one.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet!&lt;br&gt;
Announce to my people their rebellion, to the house of Jacob their sins.&lt;br&gt;
Yet day after day they seek me and delight to know my ways,&lt;br&gt;
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;&lt;br&gt;
they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.&lt;br&gt;
“Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”&lt;br&gt;
Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers.&lt;br&gt;
Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist.&lt;br&gt;
Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.&lt;br&gt;
Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself?&lt;br&gt;
Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?&lt;br&gt;
Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?&lt;br&gt;
Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke,&lt;br&gt;
to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?&lt;br&gt;
Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house;&lt;br&gt;
when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?&lt;br&gt;
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly;&lt;br&gt;
your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.&lt;br&gt;
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.&lt;br&gt;
[If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,&lt;br&gt;
if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,&lt;br&gt;
then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail.&lt;br&gt;
Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;&lt;br&gt;
you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in.]&lt;/p&gt;

the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *&lt;br&gt;
their heart is right;&lt;br&gt;
they put their trust in the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Their heart is established and will not shrink, *&lt;br&gt;
until they see their desire upon their enemies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 They have given freely to the poor, *&lt;br&gt;
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;&lt;br&gt;
they will hold up their head with honor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;[10 The wicked will see it and be angry;&lt;br&gt;
they will gnash their teeth and pine away; *&lt;br&gt;
the desires of the wicked will perish.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish. But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived,&lt;br&gt;
what God has prepared for those who love him”—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. [And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have the mind of Christ.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Micah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear what the LORD says: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.&lt;br&gt;
Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.&lt;br&gt;
“O my people, what have I done to you? In what have I wearied you? Answer me!&lt;br&gt;
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery;&lt;br&gt;
and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.&lt;br&gt;
O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised, what Balaam son of Beor answered him,&lt;br&gt;
and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD.”&lt;br&gt;
“With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high?&lt;br&gt;
Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?&lt;br&gt;
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of rivers of oil?&lt;br&gt;
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”&lt;br&gt;
He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you&lt;br&gt;
but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-15&#34;&gt;Psalm 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, quis habitabit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *&lt;br&gt;
who may abide upon your holy hill?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *&lt;br&gt;
who speaks the truth from his heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	There is no guile upon his tongue;&lt;br&gt;
he does no evil to his friend; *&lt;br&gt;
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *&lt;br&gt;
but he honors those who fear the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He has sworn to do no wrong *&lt;br&gt;
and does not take back his word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *&lt;br&gt;
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Whoever does these things *&lt;br&gt;
shall never be overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-118-31_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 1:18-31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&amp;rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no gloom for those who were in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;&lt;br&gt;
those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash; on them light has shined.&lt;br&gt;
You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy;&lt;br&gt;
they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;br&gt;
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The LORD is my light and my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
whom then shall I fear? *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is the strength of my life;&lt;br&gt;
of whom then shall I be afraid?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5 One thing have I asked of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
one thing I seek; *&lt;br&gt;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days&lt;br&gt;
of my life;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
and to seek him in his temple.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7 For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe&lt;br&gt;
in his shelter; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling&lt;br&gt;
and set me high upon a rock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Even now he lifts up my head *&lt;br&gt;

I will sing and make music to the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on me and answer me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11 You speak in my heart and say, &amp;ldquo;Seek my face.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Your face, LORD, will I seek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Hide not your face from me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 You have been my helper;&lt;br&gt;
cast me not away; *&lt;br&gt;
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose. For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters. What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.” Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee. He left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali, on the road by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—&lt;br&gt;
the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,&lt;br&gt;
and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that time Jesus began to proclaim, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
But I said, &amp;ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-401-12&#34;&gt;Psalm 40:1-12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expectans, expectavi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I waited patiently upon the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he stooped to me and heard my cry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the mire and clay; *&lt;br&gt;
he set my feet upon a high cliff and made my footing sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 He put a new song in my mouth,&lt;br&gt;
a song of praise to our God; *&lt;br&gt;
many shall see, and stand in awe,&lt;br&gt;
and put their trust in the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Happy are they who trust in the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
they do not resort to evil spirits or turn to false gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God!&lt;br&gt;
how great your wonders and your plans for us! *&lt;br&gt;
there is none who can be compared with you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Oh, that I could make them known and tell them! *&lt;br&gt;
but they are more than I can count.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 In sacrifice and offering you take no pleasure *&lt;br&gt;
(you have given me ears to hear you);&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required, *&lt;br&gt;
and so I said, &amp;ldquo;Behold, I come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 In the roll of the book it is written concerning me: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;I love to do your will, O my God;&lt;br&gt;
your law is deep in my heart.&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; *&lt;br&gt;
behold, I did not restrain my lips;&lt;br&gt;
and that, O LORD, you know.&lt;br&gt;
11 Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart;&lt;br&gt;
I have spoken of your faithfulness and your deliverance; *&lt;br&gt;
I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the great congregation.&lt;br&gt;
12 You are the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
do not withhold your compassion from me; *&lt;br&gt;
let your love and your faithfulness keep me safe for ever,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great congregation; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus, for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind&amp;ndash; just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you&amp;ndash; so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.” And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples, and as he watched Jesus walk by, he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?” He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon. One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed). He brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You are to be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan proclaimed him your beloved Son and anointed him with the Holy Spirit: Grant that all who are baptized into his Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly confess him as Lord and Savior; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-29&#34;&gt;Psalm 29&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Afferte Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Ascribe to the LORD, you gods, *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;&lt;br&gt;
the God of glory thunders; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is upon the mighty waters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The voice of the LORD is a powerful voice; *&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD is a voice of splendor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedar trees; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *&lt;br&gt;
and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire;&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The voice of the LORD makes the oak trees writhe *&lt;br&gt;
and strips the forests bare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	And in the temple of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
all are crying, &amp;ldquo;Glory!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The LORD sits enthroned above the flood; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD sits enthroned as King for evermore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	The LORD shall give strength to his people; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD shall give his people the blessing of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.&lt;br&gt;
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;br&gt;
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and&lt;br&gt;
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;
Christ our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and&lt;br&gt;
glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *&lt;br&gt;
your majesty is praised above the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
to quell the enemy and the avenger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *&lt;br&gt;
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,&lt;br&gt;
who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, &amp;ldquo;Your God reigns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;&lt;br&gt;
for in plain sight they see the return of the LORD to Zion.&lt;br&gt;
Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations;&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;

his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&amp;rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to which of the angels did God ever say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let all God&amp;rsquo;s angels worship him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the angels he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the Son he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;&lt;br&gt;
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;&lt;br&gt;
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.&lt;br&gt;
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness&lt;br&gt;
have seen a great light;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
on them light has shined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have multiplied the nation,&lt;br&gt;
you have increased its joy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they rejoice before you&lt;br&gt;
as with joy at the harvest,&lt;br&gt;
as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the yoke of their burden,&lt;br&gt;
and the bar across their shoulders,&lt;br&gt;
the rod of their oppressor,&lt;br&gt;
you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the boots of the tramping warriors&lt;br&gt;
and all the garments rolled in blood&lt;br&gt;
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a child has been born for us,&lt;br&gt;
a son given to us;&lt;br&gt;
authority rests upon his shoulders;&lt;br&gt;
and he is named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,&lt;br&gt;
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His authority shall grow continually,&lt;br&gt;
and there shall be endless peace&lt;br&gt;
for the throne of David and his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will establish and uphold it&lt;br&gt;
with justice and with righteousness&lt;br&gt;
from this time onward and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-96&#34;&gt;Psalm 96&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantate Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Declare his glory among the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and his wonders among all peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
he is more to be feared than all gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *&lt;br&gt;
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ascribe to the LORD the honor due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
bring offerings and come into his courts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *&lt;br&gt;
let the whole earth tremble before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Tell it out among the nations: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is King! *&lt;br&gt;
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;&lt;br&gt;
he will judge the peoples with equity.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;&lt;br&gt;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *&lt;br&gt;
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy&lt;br&gt;
before the LORD when he comes, *&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He will judge the world with righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with his truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Titus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&amp;ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God, Light from Light,&lt;br&gt;
true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father;&lt;br&gt;
through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven,&lt;br&gt;
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary&lt;br&gt;
and became truly human.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father,&lt;br&gt;
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,&lt;br&gt;
who has spoken through the prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We praise you and we bless you, holy and gracious God, source of life abundant. From before time you made ready the creation. Your Spirit moved over the deep and brought all things into being: sun, moon, and stars; earth, winds, and waters; and every living thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made us in your image, and taught us to walk in your ways. But we rebelled against you, and wandered far away; and yet, as a mother cares for her children, you would not forget us. Time and again you called us to live in the fullness of your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this day we join with Saints and Angels in the chorus of praise that rings through eternity, lifting our voices to magnify you as we sing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory and honor and praise to you, holy and living God. To deliver us from the power of sin and death and to reveal the riches of your grace, you looked with favor upon Mary, your willing servant, that she might conceive and bear a son, Jesus the holy child of God. Living among us, Jesus loved us. He broke bread with outcasts and sinners, healed the sick, and proclaimed good news to the poor. He yearned to draw all the world to himself yet we were heedless of his call to walk in love. Then, the time came for him to complete upon the cross the sacrifice of his life, and to be glorified by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, Jesus was at table with his friends. He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As supper was ending, Jesus took the cup of wine. Again, he gave thanks to you, gave it to them, and said: “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is poured out for you and for all for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now gathered at your table, O God of all creation, and remembering Christ, crucified and risen, who was and is and is to come, we offer to you our gifts of bread and wine, 	and ourselves, a living sacrifice. Pour out your Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Body and Blood of Christ. Breathe your Spirit over the whole earth and make us your new creation, the Body of Christ given for the world you have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fullness of time bring us, with blessed Thomas, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, from every tribe and language and people and nation, to feast at the banquet prepared from the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Christ and with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to you be honor, glory, and praise, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light all the candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE. The center candle is the Christ candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of hope, peace, joy, and love. As Mary and Joseph welcomed you into the world, now help us welcome you into our lives. Give us courage to hope; strength to seek peace. Fill our spirits with joy; and our hearts with love. Through Jesus Christ, the Lord of all. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you have caused this holy night to shine with the brightness of the true Light: Grant that we, who have known the mystery of that Light on earth, may also enjoy him perfectly in heaven; where with you and the Holy Spirit he lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness&lt;br&gt;
have seen a great light;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
on them light has shined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have multiplied the nation,&lt;br&gt;
you have increased its joy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they rejoice before you&lt;br&gt;
as with joy at the harvest,&lt;br&gt;
as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the yoke of their burden,&lt;br&gt;
and the bar across their shoulders,&lt;br&gt;
the rod of their oppressor,&lt;br&gt;
you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the boots of the tramping warriors&lt;br&gt;
and all the garments rolled in blood&lt;br&gt;
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a child has been born for us,&lt;br&gt;
a son given to us;&lt;br&gt;
authority rests upon his shoulders;&lt;br&gt;
and he is named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,&lt;br&gt;
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His authority shall grow continually,&lt;br&gt;
and there shall be endless peace&lt;br&gt;
for the throne of David and his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will establish and uphold it&lt;br&gt;
with justice and with righteousness&lt;br&gt;
from this time onward and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Declare his glory among the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and his wonders among all peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
he is more to be feared than all gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *&lt;br&gt;
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ascribe to the LORD the honor due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
bring offerings and come into his courts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *&lt;br&gt;
let the whole earth tremble before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Tell it out among the nations: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is King! *&lt;br&gt;
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;&lt;br&gt;
he will judge the peoples with equity.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;&lt;br&gt;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *&lt;br&gt;
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy&lt;br&gt;
before the LORD when he comes, *&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He will judge the world with righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with his truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Titus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, ‘Do not be afraid; for see—I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.’ And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Glory to God in the highest heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and on earth peace among those whom he favours!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.’ So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God, Light from Light,&lt;br&gt;
true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father;&lt;br&gt;
through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven,&lt;br&gt;
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary&lt;br&gt;
and became truly human.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father,&lt;br&gt;
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,&lt;br&gt;
who has spoken through the prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Glory and praise to you, O living God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God our thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We praise you and we bless you, holy and gracious God, source of life abundant. From before time you made ready the creation. Your Spirit moved over the deep and brought all things into being: sun, moon, and stars; earth, winds, and waters; and every living thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made us in your image, and taught us to walk in your ways. But we rebelled against you, and wandered far away; and yet, as a mother cares for her children, you would not forget us. Time and again you called us to live in the fullness of your love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this day we join with Saints and Angels in the chorus of praise that rings through eternity, lifting our voices to magnify you as we sing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-130&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-130&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glory and honor and praise to you, holy and living God. To deliver us from the power of sin and death and to reveal the riches of your grace, you looked with favor upon Mary, your willing servant, that she might conceive and bear a son, Jesus the holy child of God. Living among us, Jesus loved us. He broke bread with outcasts and sinners, healed the sick, and proclaimed good news to the poor. He yearned to draw all the world to himself yet we were heedless of his call to walk in love. Then, the time came for him to complete upon the cross the sacrifice of his life, and to be glorified by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, Jesus was at table with his friends. He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As supper was ending, Jesus took the cup of wine. Again, he gave thanks to you, gave it to them, and said: “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is poured out for you and for all for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now gathered at your table, O God of all creation, and remembering Christ, crucified and risen, who was and is and is to come, we offer to you our gifts of bread and wine, 	and ourselves, a living sacrifice. Pour out your Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Body and Blood of Christ. Breathe your Spirit over the whole earth and make us your new creation, the Body of Christ given for the world you have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fullness of time bring us, with blessed Thomas, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, from every tribe and language and people and nation, to feast at the banquet prepared from the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Christ and with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to you be honor, glory, and praise, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, third, and fourth candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving God, your mercy and compassion endure forever. Open our hearts, that we may receive your love; and following the example of your Son, spread that love to a love-starved world. Through Jesus Christ, who loved us to the end. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

bid Thou our sad divisions cease, and be Thyself our King of Peace.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purify our conscience, Almighty God, by your daily visitation, that your Son Jesus Christ, at his coming, may find in us a mansion prepared for himself; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel. He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name, including yourselves who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all God&amp;rsquo;s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means, “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, and third candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, and the third candle is JOY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. (Isaiah 55:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, you came to us in human flesh and you abide with us in the Holy Spirit. Fill us with your joy, and help us shine as a light to the world. Through Jesus Christ, who makes our joy complete. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, thou Key of David, come, and open wide our heavenly home;&lt;br&gt;
make safe the way that leads on high, and close the path to misery.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Day-spring from on high and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;&lt;br&gt;
disperse the gloomy clouds of night, and death&amp;rsquo;s dark shadow put to flight.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom;&lt;br&gt;
like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing.&lt;br&gt;
The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.&lt;br&gt;
They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.&lt;br&gt;
Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.&lt;br&gt;
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, &amp;ldquo;Be strong, do not fear!&lt;br&gt;
Here is your God. He will come with vengeance,&lt;br&gt;
with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;&lt;br&gt;
then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy.&lt;br&gt;
For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;&lt;br&gt;
the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water;&lt;br&gt;
the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes.&lt;br&gt;
A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way;&lt;br&gt;
the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God&amp;rsquo;s people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.&lt;br&gt;
No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it;&lt;br&gt;
they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.&lt;br&gt;
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing;&lt;br&gt;
everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;br&gt;
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle of James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be patient, therefore, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains. You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that you may not be judged. See, the Judge is standing at the doors! As an example of suffering and patience, beloved, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?” Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them. And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Come, O Lord, and save us.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hymnal-s-130&#34;&gt;Hymnal S-130&lt;/h4&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risen Lord, be known to us in the breaking of the Bread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first and second candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. (Colossians 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in ancient times didst give the law, in cloud and majesty and awe.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, thou Branch of Jesse&amp;rsquo;s tree, free them from Satan&amp;rsquo;s tyranny&lt;br&gt;
that trust thy mighty power save, and give them victory o&amp;rsquo;er the grave.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.&lt;br&gt;
The spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
His delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear;&lt;br&gt;
but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid,&lt;br&gt;
the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.&lt;br&gt;
The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.&lt;br&gt;
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder&amp;rsquo;s den.&lt;br&gt;
They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain;&lt;br&gt;
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Give the King your justice, O God, *&lt;br&gt;
and your righteousness to the King&amp;rsquo;s Son;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 That he may rule your people righteously *&lt;br&gt;
and the poor with justice;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *&lt;br&gt;
and the little hills bring righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 He shall defend the needy among the people; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, *&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to another.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, *&lt;br&gt;
like showers that water the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; *&lt;br&gt;
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope. May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again Isaiah says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first candle of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-1-2-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 1-2) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, who orderest all things mightily;&lt;br&gt;
to us the path of knowledge show, and teach us in her ways to go.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spare us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all inordinate and sinful affections; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sinners do beseech thee to hear us, O Lord God; and that it may please thee to rule and govern thy holy Church Universal in the right way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee so to rule the hearts of thy servants, the President of the United States (or of this nation), and all others in authority, that they may do justice, and love mercy, and walk in the ways of truth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to make wars to cease in all the world; to give to all nations unity, peace, and concord; and to&lt;br&gt;
bestow freedom upon all peoples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to show thy pity upon all prisoners and captives, the homeless and the hungry, and all who are desolate and oppressed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to give and preserve to our use the bountiful fruits of the earth, so that in due time all may enjoy them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That It may please thee to inspire us, in our several callings, to do the work which thou givest us to do with singleness of heart as thy servants, and for the common good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In days to come the mountain of the LORD’s house&lt;br&gt;
shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills;&lt;br&gt;
all the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say,&lt;br&gt;
‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;&lt;br&gt;
that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.’&lt;br&gt;
For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples;&lt;br&gt;
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;&lt;br&gt;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.&lt;br&gt;
O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;ldquo;Let us go to the house of the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Now our feet are standing *&lt;br&gt;
within your gates, O Jerusalem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Jerusalem is built as a city *&lt;br&gt;
that is at unity with itself;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	To which the tribes go up,&lt;br&gt;
the tribes of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
the assembly of Israel,&lt;br&gt;
to praise the Name of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	For there are the thrones of judgment, *&lt;br&gt;
the thrones of the house of David.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May they prosper who love you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Peace be within your walls *&lt;br&gt;
and quietness within your towers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	For my brethren and companions&amp;rsquo; sake, *&lt;br&gt;
I pray for your prosperity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Because of the house of the LORD our God, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the disciples, “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of&lt;br&gt;
glory and praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By your will they were created and have their being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-12&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-5&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By his blood, he reconciled us.&lt;br&gt;
By his wounds, we are healed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-6&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate his death and resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
as we await the day of his coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord God of our Fathers; God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us. Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the&lt;br&gt;
world in his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-7&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept these prayers and praises, Father, through Jesus Christ our great High Priest, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, your Church gives honor, glory, and worship, from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;

by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-2&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our  sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You, Christ, are the king of glory,&lt;br&gt;
the eternal Son of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
When you became man to set us free&lt;br&gt;
you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.&lt;br&gt;
You overcame the sting of death&lt;br&gt;
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.&lt;br&gt;
You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.&lt;br&gt;
We believe that you will come and be our judge.&lt;br&gt;
Come then, Lord, and help your people,&lt;br&gt;
bought with the price of your own blood,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight&lt;br&gt;
all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;br&gt;
He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;br&gt;
He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;br&gt;
The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in God, &lt;strong&gt;the Father almighty,&lt;br&gt;
creator of heaven and earth.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;
I believe in the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
the holy catholic Church,&lt;br&gt;
the communion of saints,&lt;br&gt;
the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body,&lt;br&gt;
and the life everlasting.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Almighty and everlasting God, whose will it is to restore all things in your well-beloved Son, the King of kings and Lord of lords: Mercifully grant that the peoples of the earth, divided and enslaved by sin, may be freed and brought together under his most gracious rule; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Collect for the Presence of Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake of your love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Prayer for Mission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pb-8&#34;&gt;pb&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glory to God whose power, working in us, can do inifinitely more than we can ask or imagine: Glory to him from generation to generation in the Church, and in Christ Jesus for ever and ever. &lt;em&gt;(Ephesians 3:20,21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;all-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blessed Lord, who caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning: Grant us so to hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which you have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;&lt;br&gt;
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.&lt;br&gt;
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;&lt;br&gt;
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;&lt;br&gt;
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.&lt;br&gt;
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;&lt;br&gt;
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;&lt;br&gt;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;&lt;br&gt;
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&amp;ndash; and their descendants as well.&lt;br&gt;
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&amp;ndash; its food shall be dust!&lt;br&gt;
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely, it is God who saves me; *&lt;br&gt;
I will trust in him and not be afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will be my Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, &amp;lsquo;I am he!&amp;rsquo; and, &amp;lsquo;The time is near!&amp;rsquo; Do not go after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray for those who have served our nation and laid down their lives to protect and defend our freedom, asking that we remember their sacrifice and make right use of our liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for those who still bear the scars of their service, asking for healing for them in mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for all those who have served in the armed forces, giving of themselves to make our country strong, to defend the common good, and to create a better world for all your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for those who serve us now, especially for those in harm’s way, asking that you shield them from danger and bring them home in safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for all those who govern, asking that you turn their hearts and minds to the work of establishing a peace born of justice and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray for all those who are caught up in conflict around the globe this day, civilians and peace-keepers and the poor who have no escape, asking that we have the courage to defend the defenseless, make room for those who flee for safety, and look to that day when we will train for war no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the peace you gave us, the peace that passes all human understanding, be the peace that guides and sustains us. For it is in Jesus’ name that we pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &amp;ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&amp;rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember N&amp;hellip;, all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
