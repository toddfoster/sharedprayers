&lt;h5 id=&#34;in-the-darkness-fire-is-kindled-after-which-the-celebrant-may-address-the-people-in-these-or-similar-words&#34;&gt;In the darkness, fire is kindled; after which the Celebrant may address the people in these or similar words&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our&lt;br&gt;
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites&lt;br&gt;
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in&lt;br&gt;
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,&lt;br&gt;
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share&lt;br&gt;
in his victory over death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your&lt;br&gt;
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and&lt;br&gt;
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly&lt;br&gt;
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of&lt;br&gt;
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,&lt;br&gt;
and let your trumpets shout Salvation&lt;br&gt;
for the victory of our mighty King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth,&lt;br&gt;
bright with a glorious splendor,&lt;br&gt;
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church,&lt;br&gt;
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,&lt;br&gt;
resound with the praises of your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame,&lt;br&gt;
pray with me to God the Almighty&lt;br&gt;
for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light;&lt;br&gt;
through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who lives and reigns with him,&lt;br&gt;
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
one God, for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-3&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our&lt;br&gt;
whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,&lt;br&gt;
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who&lt;br&gt;
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,&lt;br&gt;
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children&lt;br&gt;
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the&lt;br&gt;
Red Sea on dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered&lt;br&gt;
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness&lt;br&gt;
of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,&lt;br&gt;
and rose victorious from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your&lt;br&gt;
mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you&lt;br&gt;
gave a Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and&lt;br&gt;
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy&lt;br&gt;
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings&lt;br&gt;
peace and concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined&lt;br&gt;
and man is reconciled to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this&lt;br&gt;
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away&lt;br&gt;
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no&lt;br&gt;
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all&lt;br&gt;
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in, they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.&amp;rdquo; Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to newness of life. I call upon you, therefore, now that our Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully in his holy Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Sean, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember [&lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt;] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God, who through the water of baptism has raised us from sin into newness of life, make you holy and worthy to be united with Christ for ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God, who has brought us out of bondage to sin into true and lasting freedom in the Redeemer, bring you to your eternal inheritance. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-5213-5312_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 52:13-53:12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper;&lt;br&gt;
he shall be exalted and lifted up,&lt;br&gt;
and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him&lt;br&gt;
—so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance,&lt;br&gt;
and his form beyond that of mortals—&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations;&lt;br&gt;
kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see,&lt;br&gt;
and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has believed what we have heard?&lt;br&gt;
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant,&lt;br&gt;
and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,&lt;br&gt;
nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others;&lt;br&gt;
a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces&lt;br&gt;
he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely he has borne our infirmities&lt;br&gt;
and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken,&lt;br&gt;
struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions,&lt;br&gt;
crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole,&lt;br&gt;
and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray;&lt;br&gt;
we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the Lord has laid on him&lt;br&gt;
the iniquity of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,&lt;br&gt;
yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,&lt;br&gt;
and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,&lt;br&gt;
so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away.&lt;br&gt;
Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living,&lt;br&gt;
stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked&lt;br&gt;
and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence,&lt;br&gt;
and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin,&lt;br&gt;
he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the Lord shall prosper.&lt;br&gt;
Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,&lt;br&gt;
and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,&lt;br&gt;
and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death,&lt;br&gt;
and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many,&lt;br&gt;
and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-22&#34;&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.&lt;/p&gt;

At the verse which mentions the arrival at Golgotha (John 19:17) all stand.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus replied, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.” This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, “I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Judean guards arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Judean leaders that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” Now the slaves and the guards had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Judeans come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.” When he had said this, one of the guards standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?” Jesus answered, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?” Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate’s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”  They answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” The Judean leaders replied,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are not permitted to put anyone to death.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Judeans?”  Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?”  Pilate replied, “I am not a Judean, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?”  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Judeans. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.”  Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”  Pilate asked him, “What is truth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Judean leaders again and told them, “I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Judeans?” They shouted in reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Not this man, but Barabbas!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Hail, King of the Judeans!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.” So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”  When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Crucify him! Crucify him!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.” The Judean leaders answered him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?” Jesus answered him, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Judean leaders cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge’s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Judean leaders, “Here is your King!” They cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have no king but the emperor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence.		The people stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Judeans.” Many of the Judeans read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Judeans said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Judeans,’ but, ‘This man said, I am King of the Judeans.’” Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; (now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top). So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They divided my clothes among themselves,&lt;br&gt;
and for my clothing they cast lots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.” A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Judean leaders did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.)  These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, “None of his bones shall be broken.” And again another passage of scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Judean leaders, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear People of God: Our heavenly Father sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved; that all who believe in him might be delivered from the power of sin and death, and become heirs with him of everlasting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray, therefore, for people everywhere according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for the holy Catholic Church of Christ throughout the world; For its unity in witness and service; For all bishops and other ministers and the people whom they serve; For N., our Bishop, and all the people of this diocese; For all Christians in this community; For those about to be baptized [particularly ______]; That God will confirm his Church in faith, increase it in love, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body of your faithful people is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before you for all members of your holy Church, that in their vocation and ministry they may truly and devoutly serve you; through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, kindle, we pray, in every heart the true love of peace, and guide with your wisdom those who take counsel for the nations of the earth; that in tranquillity your dominion may increase, until the earth is filled with the knowledge of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for the Jewish people who possess an eternal covenant with the Lord, who delivered them from bondage to freedom; For continued faithfulness to God’s covenant with them; For their flourishing in peace as witnesses to God’s sustaining love; For safety from all malice and harm; For the fullness of redemption for the sake of God’s Name. That unity and concord may exist between Jews and Christians, in obedience to God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of Abraham, you planted your people Israel as the root and grafted Gentiles as wild branches into a single olive tree of praise to you: As we come near to the cross, we lament Christian acts of prejudice and violence against your faithful people, of whom Jesus Christ was born. Bless the children of your covenant, so that together we may attain the fullness of your blessing for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-3&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, the comfort of all who sorrow, the strength of all who suffer: Let the cry of those in misery and need come to you, that they may find your mercy present with them in all their afflictions; and give us, we pray, the strength to serve them for the sake of him who suffered for us, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for those who have not embraced God’s redemptive love; For those who have never heard the word of salvation; For those who have lost their faith; For those hardened by sin or indifference; For the contemptuous and the scornful; For those who are enemies of the cross of Christ and persecutors of his disciples; For those who in the name of Christ have persecuted others; That God will open their hearts to the truth, and lead them to faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-4&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, the source of life and fountain of mercy, let the Gospel of your Son Jesus Christ be preached with grace and love; turn the hearts of the followers of Jesus who have harmed others in his name; lead all to repentance and amendment of life; and sustain by your loving grace all who lift their eyes to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us commit ourselves to our God, and pray for the grace of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown of life in the day of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down are being raised up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is a time to step past our embarrassment and squeamishness and to step bodily into the experience of Holy Week. There is an additional chair in case you would like to wash someone’s feet as well. However, in modern times, it is as much a spiritual act of service to allow your feet to be washed by another as it is to wash another’s feet.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and&lt;br&gt;
had washed their feet, said to them, “Do you know what I,&lt;br&gt;
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you&lt;br&gt;
an example, that you should do as I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give you a new commandment: Love one another as I have&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this shall the world know that you are my disciples: That&lt;br&gt;
you have love for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

you have graciously accepted us as living members&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
and you have fed us with spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.&lt;br&gt;

with gladness and singleness of heart;&lt;br&gt;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;br&gt;
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;br&gt;
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;br&gt;
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;br&gt;
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;br&gt;
17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;br&gt;
19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;br&gt;
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;br&gt;
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;br&gt;
29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our&lt;br&gt;
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites&lt;br&gt;
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in&lt;br&gt;
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,&lt;br&gt;
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share&lt;br&gt;
in his victory over death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your&lt;br&gt;
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and&lt;br&gt;
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly&lt;br&gt;
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of&lt;br&gt;
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,&lt;br&gt;
and let your trumpets shout Salvation&lt;br&gt;
for the victory of our mighty King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth,&lt;br&gt;
bright with a glorious splendor,&lt;br&gt;
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church,&lt;br&gt;
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,&lt;br&gt;
resound with the praises of your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame,&lt;br&gt;
pray with me to God the Almighty&lt;br&gt;
for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light;&lt;br&gt;
through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who lives and reigns with him,&lt;br&gt;
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
one God, for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-3&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our&lt;br&gt;
whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,&lt;br&gt;
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who&lt;br&gt;
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,&lt;br&gt;
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children&lt;br&gt;
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the&lt;br&gt;
Red Sea on dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when all who believe in Christ are delivered&lt;br&gt;
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness&lt;br&gt;
of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the night, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,&lt;br&gt;
and rose victorious from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your&lt;br&gt;
mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you&lt;br&gt;
gave a Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and&lt;br&gt;
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy&lt;br&gt;
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings&lt;br&gt;
peace and concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined&lt;br&gt;
and man is reconciled to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this&lt;br&gt;
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away&lt;br&gt;
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no&lt;br&gt;
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all&lt;br&gt;
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks; for you alone are God, living and true, dwelling in light inaccessible from before time and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Sean, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember [&lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt;] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper;&lt;br&gt;
he shall be exalted and lifted up,&lt;br&gt;
and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him&lt;br&gt;
—so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance,&lt;br&gt;
and his form beyond that of mortals—&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations;&lt;br&gt;
kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see,&lt;br&gt;
and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who has believed what we have heard?&lt;br&gt;
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant,&lt;br&gt;
and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him,&lt;br&gt;
nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others;&lt;br&gt;
a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces&lt;br&gt;
he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely he has borne our infirmities&lt;br&gt;
and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken,&lt;br&gt;
struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions,&lt;br&gt;
crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole,&lt;br&gt;
and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray;&lt;br&gt;
we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the Lord has laid on him&lt;br&gt;
the iniquity of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,&lt;br&gt;
yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,&lt;br&gt;
and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,&lt;br&gt;
so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away.&lt;br&gt;
Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living,&lt;br&gt;
stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked&lt;br&gt;
and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence,&lt;br&gt;
and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin,&lt;br&gt;
he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the Lord shall prosper.&lt;br&gt;
Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous,&lt;br&gt;
and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great,&lt;br&gt;
and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death,&lt;br&gt;
and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many,&lt;br&gt;
and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus replied, “I am he.” Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.” This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, “I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Judean guards arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Judean leaders that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” Now the slaves and the guards had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Judeans come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.” When he had said this, one of the guards standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?” Jesus answered, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?” Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate’s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”  They answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” The Judean leaders replied,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are not permitted to put anyone to death.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Judeans?”  Jesus answered, “Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?”  Pilate replied, “I am not a Judean, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?”  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Judeans. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.”  Pilate asked him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”  Pilate asked him, “What is truth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Judean leaders again and told them, “I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Judeans?” They shouted in reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Not this man, but Barabbas!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Hail, King of the Judeans!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.” So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”  When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Crucify him! Crucify him!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.” The Judean leaders answered him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?” Jesus answered him, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.” From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Judean leaders cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge’s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Judean leaders, “Here is your King!” They cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We have no king but the emperor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence.		The people stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Judeans.” Many of the Judeans read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Judeans said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Judeans,’ but, ‘This man said, I am King of the Judeans.’” Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; (now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top). So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They divided my clothes among themselves,&lt;br&gt;
and for my clothing they cast lots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.” A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Judean leaders did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.)  These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, “None of his bones shall be broken.” And again another passage of scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Judean leaders, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear People of God: Our heavenly Father sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved; that all who believe in him might be delivered from the power of sin and death, and become heirs with him of everlasting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray, therefore, for people everywhere according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for the holy Catholic Church of Christ throughout the world; For its unity in witness and service; For all bishops and other ministers and the people whom they serve; For N., our Bishop, and all the people of this diocese; For all Christians in this community; For those about to be baptized [particularly ______]; That God will confirm his Church in faith, increase it in love, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body of your faithful people is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before you for all members of your holy Church, that in their vocation and ministry they may truly and devoutly serve you; through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, kindle, we pray, in every heart the true love of peace, and guide with your wisdom those who take counsel for the nations of the earth; that in tranquillity your dominion may increase, until the earth is filled with the knowledge of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for the Jewish people who possess an eternal covenant with the Lord, who delivered them from bondage to freedom; For continued faithfulness to God’s covenant with them; For their flourishing in peace as witnesses to God’s sustaining love; For safety from all malice and harm; For the fullness of redemption for the sake of God’s Name. That unity and concord may exist between Jews and Christians, in obedience to God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-2&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of Abraham, you planted your people Israel as the root and grafted Gentiles as wild branches into a single olive tree of praise to you: As we come near to the cross, we lament Christian acts of prejudice and violence against your faithful people, of whom Jesus Christ was born. Bless the children of your covenant, so that together we may attain the fullness of your blessing for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, the comfort of all who sorrow, the strength of all who suffer: Let the cry of those in misery and need come to you, that they may find your mercy present with them in all their afflictions; and give us, we pray, the strength to serve them for the sake of him who suffered for us, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for those who have not embraced God’s redemptive love; For those who have never heard the word of salvation; For those who have lost their faith; For those hardened by sin or indifference; For the contemptuous and the scornful; For those who are enemies of the cross of Christ and persecutors of his disciples; For those who in the name of Christ have persecuted others; That God will open their hearts to the truth, and lead them to faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, the source of life and fountain of mercy, let the Gospel of your Son Jesus Christ be preached with grace and love; turn the hearts of the followers of Jesus who have harmed others in his name; lead all to repentance and amendment of life; and sustain by your loving grace all who lift their eyes to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us commit ourselves to our God, and pray for the grace of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown of life in the day of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-5&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down are being raised up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

show us the light of his countenance, and come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is a time to step past our embarrassment and squeamishness and to step bodily into the experience of Holy Week. There is an additional chair in case you would like to wash someone’s feet as well. However, in modern times, it is as much a spiritual act of service to allow your feet to be washed by another as it is to wash another’s feet.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and&lt;br&gt;
had washed their feet, said to them, “Do you know what I,&lt;br&gt;
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you&lt;br&gt;
an example, that you should do as I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal God, heavenly Father,&lt;br&gt;
you have graciously accepted us as living members&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
and you have fed us with spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.&lt;br&gt;
Send us now into the world in peace,&lt;br&gt;
and grant us strength and courage&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
with gladness and singleness of heart;&lt;br&gt;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;br&gt;
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;br&gt;
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;br&gt;
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;br&gt;
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;br&gt;
17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;br&gt;
19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;br&gt;
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;br&gt;
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;br&gt;
29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;
