&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our&lt;br&gt;
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites&lt;br&gt;
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in&lt;br&gt;
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,&lt;br&gt;
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share&lt;br&gt;
in his victory over death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your&lt;br&gt;
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and&lt;br&gt;
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly&lt;br&gt;
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of&lt;br&gt;
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice now,&lt;/strong&gt; heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,&lt;br&gt;
and let your trumpets shout Salvation&lt;br&gt;
for the victory of our mighty King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice and sing now,&lt;/strong&gt; all the round earth,&lt;br&gt;
bright with a glorious splendor,&lt;br&gt;
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice and be glad now,&lt;/strong&gt; Mother Church,&lt;br&gt;
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,&lt;br&gt;
resound with the praises of your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame,&lt;br&gt;
pray with me to God the Almighty&lt;br&gt;
for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light;&lt;br&gt;
through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who lives and reigns with him,&lt;br&gt;
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
one God, for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-3&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our&lt;br&gt;
whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,&lt;br&gt;
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who&lt;br&gt;
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,&lt;br&gt;
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when you brought our fathers, the children&lt;br&gt;
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the&lt;br&gt;
Red Sea on dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when all who believe in Christ are delivered&lt;br&gt;
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness&lt;br&gt;
of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,&lt;br&gt;
and rose victorious from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How wonderful&lt;/strong&gt; and beyond our knowing, O God, is your&lt;br&gt;
mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you&lt;br&gt;
gave a Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How holy is this night,&lt;/strong&gt; when wickedness is put to flight, and&lt;br&gt;
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy&lt;br&gt;
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings&lt;br&gt;
peace and concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How blessed is this night,&lt;/strong&gt; when earth and heaven are joined&lt;br&gt;
and man is reconciled to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this&lt;br&gt;
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away&lt;br&gt;
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no&lt;br&gt;
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all&lt;br&gt;
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.” So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sanctify this water, we pray you, by the power of your&lt;br&gt;
Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and&lt;br&gt;
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;
Christ our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-32&#34;&gt;People:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks; for you alone are God, living and true, dwelling in light inaccessible from before time and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;
and we pray to you, Lord our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt; all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, &amp;lsquo;After three days I will rise again.&amp;rsquo; Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, &amp;lsquo;He has been raised from the dead,&amp;rsquo; and the last deception would be worse than the first.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&amp;rdquo; So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

of whom may we seek for succor,&lt;br&gt;
but of thee, O Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who for our sins art justly displeased?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,&lt;br&gt;
O holy and most merciful Savior,&lt;br&gt;
deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;&lt;br&gt;
shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer;&lt;br&gt;
but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty,&lt;br&gt;
O holy and merciful Savior,&lt;br&gt;
thou most worthy Judge eternal.&lt;br&gt;
Suffer us not, at our last hour,&lt;br&gt;
through any pains of death, to fall from thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray in the words our Savior Christ has taught us:&lt;/p&gt;

hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-5213-5312_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 52:13-53:12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him &amp;ndash;so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;br&gt;
Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;br&gt;
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&lt;br&gt;
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away. Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the LORD shall prosper. Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-22&#34;&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-1016-25_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 10:16-25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit testifies saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he also adds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I am he.&amp;rdquo; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am he,&amp;rdquo; they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; And they said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, &amp;ldquo;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&amp;rdquo; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest&amp;rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave&amp;rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of this man&amp;rsquo;s disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &amp;ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&amp;rdquo; Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of his disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He denied it and said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &amp;ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&amp;rdquo; Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate&amp;rsquo;s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, &amp;ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&amp;rdquo; They answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&amp;rdquo; The Jews replied,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?&amp;rdquo; Pilate replied, &amp;ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;So you are a king?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is truth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &amp;ldquo;I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; They shouted in reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Here is the man!&amp;rdquo; When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; The Jews answered him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&amp;rdquo; From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&amp;rsquo;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &amp;ldquo;Here is your King!&amp;rdquo; They cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate asked them, &amp;ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&amp;rdquo; The chief priests answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have no king but the emperor.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause. The people stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo; Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &amp;ldquo;Do not write, &amp;lsquo;The King of the Jews,&amp;rsquo; but, &amp;lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Pilate answered, &amp;ldquo;What I have written I have written.&amp;rdquo; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They divided my clothes among themselves,&lt;br&gt;
and for my clothing they cast lots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &amp;ldquo;Woman, here is your son.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to the disciple, &amp;ldquo;Here is your mother.&amp;rdquo; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &amp;ldquo;I am thirsty.&amp;rdquo; A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &amp;ldquo;It is finished.&amp;rdquo; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;None of his bones shall be broken.&amp;rdquo; And again another passage of scripture says, &amp;ldquo;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear People of God: Our heavenly Father sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved; that all who believe in him might be delivered from the power of sin and death, and become heirs with him of everlasting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray, therefore, for people everywhere according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for the holy Catholic Church of Christ throughout the world; For its unity in witness and service; For all bishops and other ministers and the people whom they serve; For William, our Bishop, and all the people of this diocese; For all Christians in this community; For those about to be baptized [particularly ______]; That God will confirm his Church in faith, increase it in love, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for all nations and peoples of the earth, and for those in authority among them; For Joseph, the President of the United States; For the Congress and the Supreme Court; For the Members and Representatives of the United Nations; For all who serve the common good; That by God’s help they may seek justice and truth, and live in peace and concord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, kindle, we pray, in every heart the true love of peace, and guide with your wisdom those who take counsel for the nations of the earth; that in tranquillity your dominion may increase, until the earth is filled with the knowledge of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for all who suffer and are afflicted in body or in mind; For the hungry and the homeless, the destitute and the oppressed; For the sick, the wounded, and the crippled; For those in loneliness, fear, and anguish; For those who face temptation, doubt, and despair; For the sorrowful and bereaved; For prisoners and captives, and those in mortal danger; That God in his mercy will comfort and relieve them, and grant them the knowledge of his love, and stir up in us the will and patience to minister to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-2&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, the comfort of all who sorrow, the strength of all who suffer: Let the cry of those in misery and need come to you, that they may find your mercy present with them in all their afflictions; and give us, we pray, the strength to serve them for the sake of him who suffered for us, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray for all who have not received the Gospel of Christ; For those who have never heard the word of salvation; For those who have lost their faith; For those hardened by sin or indifference; For the contemptuous and the scornful; For those who are enemies of the cross of Christ and persecutors of his disciples; For those who in the name of Christ have persecuted others; That God will open their hearts to the truth, and lead them to faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;silence-3&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, creator of all the peoples of the earth and lover of souls: Have compassion on all who do not know you as you are revealed in your Son Jesus Christ; let your Gospel be preached with grace and power to those who have not heard it; turn the hearts of those who resist it; and bring home to your fold those who have gone astray; that there may be one flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deacon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us commit ourselves to our God, and pray for the grace of a holy life, that, with all who have departed this world and have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to God alone, we may be accounted worthy to enter into the fullness of the joy of our Lord, and receive the crown of life in the day of resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down are being raised up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is a time to step past our embarrassment and squeamishness and to step bodily into the experience of Holy Week. There is an additional chair in case you would like to wash someone’s feet as well. However, in modern times, it is as much a spiritual act of service to allow your feet to be washed by another as it is to wash another’s feet.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and&lt;br&gt;
had washed their feet, said to them, “Do you know what I,&lt;br&gt;
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you&lt;br&gt;
an example, that you should do as I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal God, heavenly Father,&lt;br&gt;
you have graciously accepted us as living members&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
and you have fed us with spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;br&gt;
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;br&gt;
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;br&gt;
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;br&gt;
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;br&gt;
17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;br&gt;
19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;br&gt;
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;br&gt;
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;br&gt;
29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Be pleased, O God, to deliver me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, make haste to help me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed&lt;br&gt;
and altogether dismayed; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune&lt;br&gt;
draw back and be disgraced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Let those who say to me &amp;ldquo;Aha!&amp;rdquo; and gloat over me turn back, *&lt;br&gt;
because they are ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&amp;rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&amp;ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&amp;ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&amp;rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&amp;rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &amp;ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&amp;rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had gone out, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-6&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-491-7_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 49:1-7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
But I said, &amp;ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-711-14&#34;&gt;Psalm 71:1-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *&lt;br&gt;
let me never be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my crag and my stronghold.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *&lt;br&gt;
my confidence since I was young.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;&lt;br&gt;
from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *&lt;br&gt;
my praise shall be always of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I have become a portent to many; *&lt;br&gt;
but you are my refuge and my strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let my mouth be full of your praise *&lt;br&gt;
and your glory all the day long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Do not cast me off in my old age; *&lt;br&gt;
forsake me not when my strength fails.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my enemies are talking against me, *&lt;br&gt;
and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 They say, &amp;ldquo;God has forsaken him;&lt;br&gt;
go after him and seize him; *&lt;br&gt;
because there is none who will save.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 O God, be not far from me; *&lt;br&gt;
come quickly to help me, O my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But I shall always wait in patience, *&lt;br&gt;
and shall praise you more and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&amp;rdquo; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say&amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Father, save me from this hour&amp;rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&amp;rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&amp;rdquo; The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, &amp;ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&amp;rdquo; He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-421-9_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 42:1-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-365-11&#34;&gt;Psalm 36:5-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixit injustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, *&lt;br&gt;
and your faithfulness to the clouds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,&lt;br&gt;
your justice like the great deep; *&lt;br&gt;
you save both man and beast, O Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 How priceless is your love, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *&lt;br&gt;
you give them drink from the river of your delights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For with you is the well of life, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your light we see light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *&lt;br&gt;
and your favor to those who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Let not the foot of the proud come near me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the hand of the wicked push me aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-911-15_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 9:11-15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everliving God, in your tender love for the human race you sent your Son our Savior Jesus Christ to take upon him our nature, and to suffer death upon the cross, giving us the example of his great humility: Mercifully grant that we may walk in the way of his suffering, and also share in his resurrection; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;today-we-read-psalm-31-in-its-entirety-in-solidarity-with-those-suffering-in-ukraine&#34;&gt;Today we read Psalm 31 in its entirety, in solidarity with those suffering in Ukraine.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-31&#34;&gt;Psalm 31&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Into your hands I commend my spirit, *&lt;br&gt;
for you have redeemed me,&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, O God of truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *&lt;br&gt;
and I put my trust in the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *&lt;br&gt;
for you have seen my affliction;&lt;br&gt;
you know my distress.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *&lt;br&gt;
you have set my feet in an open place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For my life is wasted with grief,&lt;br&gt;
and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors,&lt;br&gt;
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *&lt;br&gt;
when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;&lt;br&gt;
fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *&lt;br&gt;
rather, let the wicked be put to shame;&lt;br&gt;
let them be silent in the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
haughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	How great is your goodness, O LORD!&lt;br&gt;
which you have laid up for those who fear you; *&lt;br&gt;
which you have done in the sight of all&lt;br&gt;
for those who put their trust in you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who slander them; *&lt;br&gt;
you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Blessed be the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged city.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Yet I said in my alarm,&lt;br&gt;
I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty&lt;br&gt;
when I cried out to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD protects the faithful,&lt;br&gt;
but repays to the full those who act haughtily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	Be strong and let your heart take courage, *&lt;br&gt;
all you who wait for the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_philippians-25-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dramatis personæ: 	People, Narrator, Jesus, Peter, Servant, Pilate, Soldier, Criminal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	When the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. He said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table. For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But he said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	He said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	No, not a thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, “And he was counted among the lawless”; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Lord, look, here are two swords.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	It is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. When he reached the place, he said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, and he said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Lord, should we strike with the sword?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	No more of this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant:&lt;/em&gt;	This man also was with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But he denied it, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Woman, I do not know him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	A little later someone else, on seeing him, said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant:&lt;/em&gt;	You also are one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Man, I am not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then about an hour later yet another kept insisting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant:&lt;/em&gt;	Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter:&lt;/em&gt;	Man, I do not know what you are talking about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‘Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.’ And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;		Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and kept asking him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soldier:&lt;/em&gt;	Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	They kept heaping many other insults on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council. They said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	If you are the Messiah, tell us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I question you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you, then, the Son of God?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	You say that I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you the king of the Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	You say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	I find no basis for an accusation against this man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But they were insistent and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign. He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate. That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people, and said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death. I will therefore have him flogged and release him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	(This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.) Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again; but they kept shouting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Crucify, crucify him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	A third time he said to them,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pilate:&lt;/em&gt;	Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted. He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus. A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him. But Jesus turned to them and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For the days are surely coming when they will say, “Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.” Then they will begin to say to the mountains, “Fall on us”; and to the hills, “Cover us.” For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SILENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Congregation stands at this time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt; Then Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And they cast lots to divide his clothing. And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soldier:&lt;/em&gt;	If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	There was also an inscription over him, ‘This is the King of the Jews.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People:&lt;/em&gt;	Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	But the other rebuked him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Criminal:&lt;/em&gt;	Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus:&lt;/em&gt;	Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	Having said this, he breathed his last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soldier:&lt;/em&gt;	Certainly this man was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Narrator:&lt;/em&gt;	And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts. But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council, had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him.
