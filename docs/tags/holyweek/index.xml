&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to God in the highest,&lt;br&gt;
and peace to God’s people on earth.&lt;br&gt;
Lord God, heavenly King,&lt;br&gt;

you are seated at the right hand of the Father:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For you alone are the Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
you alone are the Lord,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, who for our redemption gave your only-begotten Son to the death of the cross, and by his glorious resurrection delivered us from the power of our enemy: Grant us so to die daily to sin, that we may evermore live with him in the joy of his resurrection; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1181-214-24&#34;&gt;Psalm 118:1-2,14-24&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confitemini Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *&lt;br&gt;
his mercy endures for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let Israel now proclaim, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 The LORD is my strength and my song, *&lt;br&gt;
and he has become my salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 There is a sound of exultation and victory *&lt;br&gt;
in the tents of the righteous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 &amp;ldquo;The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! *&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 I shall not die, but live, *&lt;br&gt;
and declare the works of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 The LORD has punished me sorely, *&lt;br&gt;
but he did not hand me over to death.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will enter them;&lt;br&gt;
I will offer thanks to the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he who is righteous may enter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and have become my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 The same stone which the builders rejected *&lt;br&gt;
has become the chief cornerstone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;23 This is the LORD&amp;rsquo;s doing, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is marvelous in our eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 On this day the LORD has acted; *&lt;br&gt;
we will rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_colossians-31-4_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Colossians 3:1-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&amp;rsquo; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, &amp;lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
and born of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br&gt;
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,&lt;br&gt;
was crucified, died, and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
He descended to the dead.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again.&lt;br&gt;
He ascended into heaven,&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-3&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,&lt;br&gt;
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, and bestowed upon us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal life by his grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our&lt;br&gt;
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites&lt;br&gt;
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in&lt;br&gt;
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,&lt;br&gt;
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share&lt;br&gt;
in his victory over death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your&lt;br&gt;
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and&lt;br&gt;
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly&lt;br&gt;
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of&lt;br&gt;
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice now,&lt;/strong&gt; heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,&lt;br&gt;
and let your trumpets shout Salvation&lt;br&gt;
for the victory of our mighty King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice and sing now,&lt;/strong&gt; all the round earth,&lt;br&gt;
bright with a glorious splendor,&lt;br&gt;
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejoice and be glad now,&lt;/strong&gt; Mother Church,&lt;br&gt;
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,&lt;br&gt;
resound with the praises of your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you who stand near this marvelous and holy flame,&lt;br&gt;
pray with me to God the Almighty&lt;br&gt;
for the grace to sing the worthy praise of this great light;&lt;br&gt;
through Jesus Christ his Son our Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who lives and reigns with him,&lt;br&gt;
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
one God, for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-3&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly right and good, always and everywhere, with our&lt;br&gt;
whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible,&lt;br&gt;
almighty, and eternal God, and your only-begotten Son,&lt;br&gt;
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who&lt;br&gt;
at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,&lt;br&gt;
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when you brought our fathers, the children&lt;br&gt;
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the&lt;br&gt;
Red Sea on dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when all who believe in Christ are delivered&lt;br&gt;
from the gloom of sin, and are restored to grace and holiness&lt;br&gt;
of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the night,&lt;/strong&gt; when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,&lt;br&gt;
and rose victorious from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How wonderful&lt;/strong&gt; and beyond our knowing, O God, is your&lt;br&gt;
mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you&lt;br&gt;
gave a Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How holy is this night,&lt;/strong&gt; when wickedness is put to flight, and&lt;br&gt;
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy&lt;br&gt;
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings&lt;br&gt;
peace and concord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How blessed is this night,&lt;/strong&gt; when earth and heaven are joined&lt;br&gt;
and man is reconciled to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this&lt;br&gt;
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away&lt;br&gt;
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no&lt;br&gt;
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all&lt;br&gt;
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God of unchangeable power and eternal light: Look favorably on your whole Church, that wonderful and sacred mystery; by the effectual working of your providence, carry out in tranquillity the plan of salvation; let the whole world see and know that things which were cast down are being raised up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and that all things are being brought to their perfection by him through whom all things were made, your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.” So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Almighty God, for the gift of water.&lt;br&gt;
Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.&lt;br&gt;
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage&lt;br&gt;
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus&lt;br&gt;
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death&lt;br&gt;
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are&lt;br&gt;
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his&lt;br&gt;
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his&lt;br&gt;
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in&lt;br&gt;
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sanctify this water, we pray you, by the power of your&lt;br&gt;
Holy Spirit, that those who here are cleansed from sin and&lt;br&gt;
born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus&lt;br&gt;
Christ our Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit, be all honor and&lt;br&gt;
glory, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavenly Father, we thank you that by water and the Holy&lt;br&gt;
Spirit you have bestowed upon these your servants the&lt;br&gt;
forgiveness of sin, and have raised them to the new life of&lt;br&gt;
grace. Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit. Give them&lt;br&gt;
an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to&lt;br&gt;
persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy&lt;br&gt;
and wonder in all your works. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to rejoice in the splendor of your radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence, they offer you unceasing praise. Joining with them, and giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you, and glorify your Name, as we sing,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrant and People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We praise you, we bless you,&lt;br&gt;
we give thanks to you,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;em&gt;N. and&lt;/em&gt; all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and rested on this holy Sabbath, so we may await with him the coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_job-141-14_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Job 14:1-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job said, &amp;ldquo;A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble, comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow and does not last.&lt;br&gt;
Do you fix your eyes on such a one? Do you bring me into judgment with you?&lt;br&gt;
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one can.&lt;br&gt;
Since their days are determined, and the number of their months is known to you, and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,&lt;br&gt;
look away from them, and desist, that they may enjoy, like laborers, their days.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.&lt;br&gt;
Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,&lt;br&gt;
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.&lt;br&gt;
But mortals die, and are laid low; humans expire, and where are they?&lt;br&gt;
As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,&lt;br&gt;
so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused out of their sleep.&lt;br&gt;
Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!&lt;br&gt;
If mortals die, will they live again? All the days of my service I would wait until my release should come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-311-415-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 31:1-4,15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-peter-41-8_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Peter 4:1-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-third-lesson-_matthew-2757-66_&#34;&gt;The Third Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Matthew 27:57-66&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, &amp;lsquo;After three days I will rise again.&amp;rsquo; Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, &amp;lsquo;He has been raised from the dead,&amp;rsquo; and the last deception would be worse than the first.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&amp;rdquo; So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of life we are in death;&lt;br&gt;
of whom may we seek for succor,&lt;br&gt;
but of thee, O Lord,&lt;br&gt;
who for our sins art justly displeased?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,&lt;br&gt;
O holy and most merciful Savior,&lt;br&gt;
deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;&lt;br&gt;
shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer;&lt;br&gt;
but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty,&lt;br&gt;
O holy and merciful Savior,&lt;br&gt;
thou most worthy Judge eternal.&lt;br&gt;
Suffer us not, at our last hour,&lt;br&gt;
through any pains of death, to fall from thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray in the words our Savior Christ has taught us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer death upon the cross; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-hear-gods-word&#34;&gt;We Hear God&amp;rsquo;s Word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-5213-5312_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 52:13-53:12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him &amp;ndash;so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;br&gt;
Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;br&gt;
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&lt;br&gt;
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away. Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the LORD shall prosper. Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-22&#34;&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit testifies saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he also adds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I am he.&amp;rdquo; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am he,&amp;rdquo; they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; And they said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, &amp;ldquo;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&amp;rdquo; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest&amp;rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave&amp;rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of this man&amp;rsquo;s disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &amp;ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&amp;rdquo; Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of his disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He denied it and said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &amp;ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&amp;rdquo; Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate&amp;rsquo;s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, &amp;ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&amp;rdquo; They answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&amp;rdquo; The Jews replied,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?&amp;rdquo; Pilate replied, &amp;ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;So you are a king?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is truth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &amp;ldquo;I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; They shouted in reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Here is the man!&amp;rdquo; When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; The Jews answered him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&amp;rdquo; From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-8&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&amp;rsquo;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &amp;ldquo;Here is your King!&amp;rdquo; They cried out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate asked them, &amp;ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&amp;rdquo; The chief priests answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have no king but the emperor.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pause. The people stand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo; Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &amp;ldquo;Do not write, &amp;lsquo;The King of the Jews,&amp;rsquo; but, &amp;lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Pilate answered, &amp;ldquo;What I have written I have written.&amp;rdquo; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They divided my clothes among themselves,&lt;br&gt;
and for my clothing they cast lots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &amp;ldquo;Woman, here is your son.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to the disciple, &amp;ldquo;Here is your mother.&amp;rdquo; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &amp;ldquo;I am thirsty.&amp;rdquo; A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &amp;ldquo;It is finished.&amp;rdquo; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;None of his bones shall be broken.&amp;rdquo; And again another passage of scripture says, &amp;ldquo;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

Give mercy and grace to the living; pardon and rest to the dead; to your holy Church peace and concord; and to us sinners everlasting life and glory; for with the Father and Holy Spirit you live and reign, one God, now and for ever.

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-116110-17&#34;&gt;Psalm 116:1,10-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dilexi, quoniam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *&lt;br&gt;
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever&lt;br&gt;
I called upon him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	How shall I repay the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
for all the good things he has done for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I will lift up the cup of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Precious in the sight of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
is the death of his servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	O LORD, I am your servant; *&lt;br&gt;
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;&lt;br&gt;
you have freed me from my bonds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	In the courts of the LORD&amp;rsquo;S house, *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is a time to step past our embarrassment and squeamishness and to step bodily into the experience of Holy Week. There is an additional chair in case you would like to wash someone’s feet as well. However, in modern times, it is as much a spiritual act of service to allow your feet to be washed by another as it is to wash another’s feet.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Lord Jesus, after he had supped with his disciples and&lt;br&gt;
had washed their feet, said to them, “Do you know what I,&lt;br&gt;
your Lord and Master, have done to you? I have given you&lt;br&gt;
an example, that you should do as I have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give you a new commandment: Love one another as I have&lt;br&gt;
loved you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peace is my last gift to you, my own peace I now leave with&lt;br&gt;
you; peace which the world cannot give, I give to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this shall the world know that you are my disciples: That&lt;br&gt;
you have love for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Lord, have mercy.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;br&gt;
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;br&gt;
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;br&gt;
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;br&gt;
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;br&gt;
17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;br&gt;
19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;br&gt;
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;br&gt;
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;br&gt;
29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Be pleased, O God, to deliver me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, make haste to help me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&amp;rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&amp;ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&amp;ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&amp;rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&amp;rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &amp;ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&amp;rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had gone out, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him.

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-24&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eternal God, heavenly Father,&lt;br&gt;
you have graciously accepted us as living members&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
and you have fed us with spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.&lt;br&gt;
Send us now into the world in peace,&lt;br&gt;
and grant us strength and courage&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
with gladness and singleness of heart;&lt;br&gt;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, we pray you graciously to behold this your family, for whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed, and given into the hands of sinners, and to suffer death upon the cross; who lives and reigns for ever and ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;processional-hymn-_o-love-how-deep_-hymnal-448&#34;&gt;Processional Hymn: &lt;em&gt;O love, how deep&lt;/em&gt; (Hymnal 448)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,&lt;br&gt;
how passing thought and fantasy,&lt;br&gt;
that God, the Son of God, should take&lt;br&gt;
our mortal form for mortals&amp;rsquo; sake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
For us baptized, for us he bore&lt;br&gt;
his holy fast and hungered sore;&lt;br&gt;
for us temptations sharp he knew;&lt;br&gt;
for us the tempter overthrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
For us he prayed; for us he taught;&lt;br&gt;
for us his daily works he wrought:&lt;br&gt;
by words and signs and actions, thus&lt;br&gt;
still seeking not himself, but us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
For us to wicked hands betrayed,&lt;br&gt;
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,&lt;br&gt;
he bore the shameful cross and death;&lt;br&gt;
for us gave up his dying breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For us he rose from death again;&lt;br&gt;
for us he went on high to reign;&lt;br&gt;
for us he sent his Spirit here&lt;br&gt;
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
All glory to our Lord and God&lt;br&gt;
for love so deep, so high, so broad;&lt;br&gt;
the Trinity whom we adore&lt;br&gt;
forever and forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, by the passion of your blessed Son you made an instrument of shameful death to be for us the means of life: Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may gladly suffer shame and loss for the sake of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_isaiah-491-7_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Isaiah 49:1-7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
But I said, &amp;ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-711-14&#34;&gt;Psalm 71:1-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *&lt;br&gt;
let me never be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my crag and my stronghold.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *&lt;br&gt;
my confidence since I was young.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;&lt;br&gt;
from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *&lt;br&gt;
my praise shall be always of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I have become a portent to many; *&lt;br&gt;
but you are my refuge and my strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let my mouth be full of your praise *&lt;br&gt;
and your glory all the day long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Do not cast me off in my old age; *&lt;br&gt;
forsake me not when my strength fails.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my enemies are talking against me, *&lt;br&gt;
and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 They say, &amp;ldquo;God has forsaken him;&lt;br&gt;
go after him and seize him; *&lt;br&gt;
because there is none who will save.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 O God, be not far from me; *&lt;br&gt;
come quickly to help me, O my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But I shall always wait in patience, *&lt;br&gt;
and shall praise you more and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-118-31_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 1:18-31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&amp;rdquo; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say&amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Father, save me from this hour&amp;rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&amp;rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&amp;rdquo; The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, &amp;ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&amp;rdquo; He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-6&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-365-11&#34;&gt;Psalm 36:5-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixit injustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, *&lt;br&gt;
and your faithfulness to the clouds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,&lt;br&gt;
your justice like the great deep; *&lt;br&gt;
you save both man and beast, O Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 How priceless is your love, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *&lt;br&gt;
you give them drink from the river of your delights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For with you is the well of life, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your light we see light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *&lt;br&gt;
and your favor to those who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Let not the foot of the proud come near me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the hand of the wicked push me aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-911-15_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 9:11-15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ has died.&lt;br&gt;
Christ is risen.&lt;br&gt;
Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus and his disciples had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, &amp;ldquo;Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, `The Lord needs them.&amp;rsquo; And he will send them immediately.&amp;rdquo; This took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tell the daughter of Zion,&lt;br&gt;
Look, your king is coming to you,&lt;br&gt;
humble, and mounted on a donkey,&lt;br&gt;
and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest heaven!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, &amp;ldquo;Who is this?&amp;rdquo; The crowds were saying, &amp;ldquo;This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right to praise you, Almighty God, for the acts of love by which you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. On this day he entered the holy city of Jerusalem in triumph, and was proclaimed as King of kings by those who spread their garments and branches of palm along his way. Let these branches be for us signs of his victory, and grant that we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our King, and follow him in the way that leads to eternal life; who lives and reigns in glory with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the Lord; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22 The same stone which the builders rejected *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies&lt;br&gt;

when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-1&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;judas&#34;&gt;Judas:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will you give me if I betray him to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-2&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-13&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-3&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, “The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-4&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, he took his place with the twelve; and while they were eating, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-1&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-5&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-14&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely not I, Lord?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-2&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-6&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judas, who betrayed him, said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;judas-1&#34;&gt;Judas:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely not I, Rabbi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-3&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-7&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-4&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, eat; this is my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-8&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-5&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-9&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-6&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will strike the shepherd,&lt;br&gt;
the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-10&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;peter&#34;&gt;Peter:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though all become deserters because of you, I will never desert you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-7&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;peter-1&#34;&gt;Peter:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-11&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so said all the disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-8&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit here while I go over there and pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-12&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and agitated. Then he said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-9&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-13&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-10&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-14&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-11&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, could you not stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-15&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he went away for the second time and prayed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-12&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-16&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-13&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-17&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;judas-2&#34;&gt;Judas:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-18&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once he came up to Jesus and kissed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;judas-3&#34;&gt;Judas:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, Rabbi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-14&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend, do what you are here to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-19&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-15&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-20&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-16&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But all this has taken place, so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-21&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered. But Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and going inside, he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end. Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;witness&#34;&gt;Witness:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellow said, “I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-22&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high priest stood up and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-23&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jesus was silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest-1&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-17&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have said so. But I tell you,&lt;br&gt;
From now on you will see the Son of Man&lt;br&gt;
seated at the right hand of Power&lt;br&gt;
and coming on the clouds of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-24&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest tore his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest-2&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-15&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He deserves death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-25&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-16&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-26&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant-girl came to him and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;servant&#34;&gt;Servant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-27&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he denied it before all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;peter-2&#34;&gt;Peter:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what you are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-28&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he went out to the porch, another servant-girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;servant-1&#34;&gt;Servant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-29&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he denied it with an oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;peter-3&#34;&gt;Peter:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-30&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-17&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-31&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he began to curse, and he swore an oath,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;peter-4&#34;&gt;Peter:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know the man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-32&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment the cock crowed. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-18&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-33&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-34&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus in order to bring about his death. They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;judas-4&#34;&gt;Judas:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest-3&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is that to us? See to it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-35&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest-4&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-36&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter’s field as a place to bury foreigners. For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price, and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you the King of the Jews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-19&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-37&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-1&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not hear how many accusations they make against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-38&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd, anyone whom they wanted. At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas. So after they had gathered, Pilate said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-2&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-39&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over. While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;wife&#34;&gt;Wife:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-40&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed. The governor again said to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-3&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-18&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barabbas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-4&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-19&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let him be crucified!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-5&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, what evil has he done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-shouting&#34;&gt;People (shouting):&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let him be crucified!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-41&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-6&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-42&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the people as a whole answered,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-20&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His blood be on us and on our children!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-43&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters, and they gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-21&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hail, King of the Jews!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-44&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. After mocking him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they went out, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon; they compelled this man to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;silencethe-congregation-stands-at-this-time&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SILENCE			(The Congregation stands at this time.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-45&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots; then they sat down there and kept watch over him. Over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-22&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-46&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-23&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, “I am God’s Son.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-47&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-48&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;jesus-20&#34;&gt;Jesus:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-49&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” When some of the bystanders heard it, they said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-24&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This man is calling for Elijah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-50&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink. But the others said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-25&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-51&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split. The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many. Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-26&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly this man was God’s Son!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-52&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many women were also there, looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and had provided for him. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-53&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;high-priest-5&#34;&gt;High Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, “After three days I will rise again.” Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, “He has been raised from the dead,” and the last deception would be worse than the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pilate-7&#34;&gt;Pilate:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;narrator-54&#34;&gt;Narrator:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;there-follows-a-great-silence-please-remain-standing-if-you-are-able&#34;&gt;There follows a great silence. Please remain standing if you are able.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-4&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;

Christ will come again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-presider-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Presider continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-5&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
