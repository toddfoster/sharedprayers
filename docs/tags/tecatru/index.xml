&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-95&#34;&gt;Psalm 95&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venite, exultemus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Come, let us sing to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For the LORD is a great God, *&lt;br&gt;
and a great King above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and the heights of the hills are his also.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The sea is his, for he made it, *&lt;br&gt;
and his hands have molded the dry land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *&lt;br&gt;
and kneel before the LORD our Maker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For he is our God,&lt;br&gt;
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Harden not your hearts,&lt;br&gt;
as your forebears did in the wilderness, *&lt;br&gt;
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah,&lt;br&gt;
when they tempted me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	They put me to the test, *&lt;br&gt;
though they had seen my works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Forty years long I detested that generation and said, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;This people are wayward in their hearts;&lt;br&gt;
they do not know my ways.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	So I swore in my wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They shall not enter into my rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?” Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!” The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?” Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people, “Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?” They left the city and were on their way to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?” Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
