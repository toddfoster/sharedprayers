<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_job-1121-10_">The First Lesson: <em>Job 1:1;2:1-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
<p>There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.</p>
<p>One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord. The Lord said to Satan, ‘Where have you come from?’ Satan answered the Lord, ‘From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.’ The Lord said to Satan, ‘Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.’ Then Satan answered the Lord, ‘Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives. But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.’ The Lord said to Satan, ‘Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.’</p>
<p>So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.</p>
<p>Then his wife said to him, ‘Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die.’ But he said to her, ‘You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not receive the bad?’ In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</p>

I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>9	Do not sweep me away with sinners, *<br>

<blockquote>
<p>11	As for me, I will live with integrity; *<br>
redeem me, O LORD, and have pity on me.<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-11-4-25-12_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 1:1-4; 2:5-12</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>
<p>Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels. But someone has testified somewhere,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘What are human beings that you are mindful of them,<br>
or mortals, that you care for them?<br>
You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;<br>
you have crowned them with glory and honour,<br>
subjecting all things under their feet.’<br>
Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them, but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honour because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,<br>
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.’</p>

<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, ‘Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?’ He answered them, ‘What did Moses command you?’ They said, ‘Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.’ But Jesus said to them, ‘Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. But from the beginning of creation, “God made them male and female.” “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.’</p>
<p>Then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. He said to them, ‘Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.’</p>
<p>People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, ‘Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.’ And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</p>

<p>Then Job answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Today also my complaint is bitter;<br>
his hand is heavy despite my groaning.<br>
O that I knew where I might find him,<br>
that I might come even to his dwelling!<br>
I would lay my case before him,<br>

I would learn what he would answer me,<br>
and understand what he would say to me.<br>
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?<br>
No; but he would give heed to me.<br>
There an upright person could reason with him,<br>
and I should be acquitted for ever by my judge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘If I go forward, he is not there;<br>
or backward, I cannot perceive him;<br>
on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him;<br>
I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.<br>
God has made my heart faint;<br>

and thick darkness would cover my face!</p>

<h5 id="lector-8">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.</p>
<p>Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

<h5 id="lector-10">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, ‘Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?’ Jesus said to him, ‘Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: “You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honour your father and mother.”’ He said to him, ‘Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.’ Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, ‘You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.’ When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.</p>
<p>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, ‘How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!’ And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, ‘Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.’ They were greatly astounded and said to one another, ‘Then who can be saved?’ Jesus looked at them and said, ‘For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.’</p>
<p>Peter began to say to him, ‘Look, we have left everything and followed you.’ Jesus said, ‘Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.’</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-51-10_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 5:1-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-14">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness; and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not presume to take this honour, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
<p>So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You are my Son,<br>
today I have begotten you’;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as he says also in another place,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You are a priest for ever,<br>
according to the order of Melchizedek.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, ‘Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.’ And he said to them, ‘What is it you want me to do for you?’ And they said to him, ‘Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.’ But Jesus said to them, ‘You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?’ They replied, ‘We are able.’ Then Jesus said to them, ‘The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.’</p>
<p>When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, ‘You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.’</p>

<h5 id="lector-18">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
<p>Then Job answered the Lord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I know that you can do all things,<br>
and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.<br>
“Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?”<br>
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br>
things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.<br>
“Hear, and I will speak;<br>
I will question you, and you declare to me.”<br>
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<br>
but now my eye sees you;<br>
therefore I despise myself,<br>
and repent in dust and ashes.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring. The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. After this Job lived for one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations. And Job died, old and full of days.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues for ever. Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p>
<p>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.</p>

When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Jesus stood still and said, ‘Call him here.’ And they called the blind man, saying to him, ‘Take heart; get up, he is calling you.’ So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. Then Jesus said to him, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ The blind man said to him, ‘My teacher, let me see again.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Go; your faith has made you well.’ Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.</p>

<h5 id="lector-24">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Ruth.</p>
<p>In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and two sons. The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. These took Moabite wives; the name of one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. When they had lived there for about ten years, both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her two sons or her husband.</p>
<p>Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had had consideration for his people and given them food. So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah. But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, ‘Go back each of you to your mother’s house. May the Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. The Lord grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your husband.’ Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud. They said to her, ‘No, we will return with you to your people.’ But Naomi said, ‘Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight and bear sons, would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the Lord has turned against me.’ Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</p>
<p>So she said, ‘See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.’ But Ruth said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Do not press me to leave you<br>
or to turn back from following you!<br>
Where you go, I will go;<br>
where you lodge, I will lodge;<br>
your people shall be my people,<br>
and your God my God.<br>
Where you die, I will die—<br>
there will I be buried.<br>
May the Lord do thus and so to me,<br>
and more as well,<br>
if even death parts me from you!’<br>
When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.</p>

<p>But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!</p>

He said, ‘Where have you laid him?’ They said to him, ‘Lord, come and see.’ Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, ‘See how he loved him!’ But some of them said, ‘Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?’</p>
<p>Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, ‘Take away the stone.’ Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, ‘Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead for four days.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?’ So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upwards and said, ‘Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.’ When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, ‘Lazarus, come out!’ The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth.

<h5 id="lector-36">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from first Samuel.</p>
<p>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters; but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the Lord had closed her womb. Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the Lord had closed her womb. So it went on year after year; as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. Her husband Elkanah said to her, ‘Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?’</p>
<p>After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the Lord. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the Lord. She was deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord, and wept bitterly. She made this vow: ‘O Lord of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head.’</p>
<p>As she continued praying before the Lord, Eli observed her mouth. Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk. So Eli said to her, ‘How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.’ But Hannah answered, ‘No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.’ Then Eli answered, ‘Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.’ And she said, ‘Let your servant find favour in your sight.’ Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.</p>
<p>They rose early in the morning and worshipped before the Lord; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, ‘I have asked him of the Lord.’</p>

and I will write them on their minds’,<br>
he also adds,<br>
‘I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.’<br>
Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>

<p>A reading from Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!’ Then Jesus asked him, ‘Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.’</p>
<p>When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, ‘Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?’ Then Jesus began to say to them, ‘Beware that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name and say, “I am he!” and they will lead many astray. When you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This is but the beginning of the birth pangs.</p>

<p>A reading from second Samuel.</p>
<p>Now these are the last words of David:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The oracle of David, son of Jesse,<br>
the oracle of the man whom God exalted,<br>
the anointed of the God of Jacob,<br>
the favourite of the Strong One of Israel:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The spirit of the Lord speaks through me,<br>
his word is upon my tongue.<br>
The God of Israel has spoken,<br>
the Rock of Israel has said to me:<br>
One who rules over people justly,<br>
ruling in the fear of God,<br>
is like the light of morning,<br>
like the sun rising on a cloudless morning,<br>
gleaming from the rain on the grassy land.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is not my house like this with God?<br>
For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,<br>
ordered in all things and secure.<br>
Will he not cause to prosper<br>
all my help and my desire?<br>
But the godless are all like thorns that are thrown away;<br>
for they cannot be picked up with the hand;<br>
to touch them one uses an iron bar<br>
or the shaft of a spear.<br>
And they are entirely consumed in fire on the spot.</p>

<p><em>Memento, Domine</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	LORD, remember David, *<br>
and all the hardships he endured;<br>
<strong>2	How he swore an oath to the LORD *<br>
and vowed a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	&ldquo;I will not come under the roof of my house, *<br>

nor let my eyelids slumber;</strong></p>

<p>5	Until I find a place for the LORD, *<br>
a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.&rdquo;<br>

we found it in the fields of Jearim.</strong></p>

<p>7	Let us go to God&rsquo;s dwelling place; *<br>
let us fall upon our knees before his footstool.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>8	Arise, O LORD, into your resting-place, *<br>
you and the ark of your strength.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>9	Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; *<br>
let your faithful people sing with joy.<br>

do not turn away the face of your Anointed.</strong></p>

<p>11	The LORD has sworn an oath to David; *<br>
in truth, he will not break it:<br>

will I set upon your throne.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	If your children keep my covenant<br>
and my testimonies that I shall teach them, *<br>
their children will sit upon your throne for evermore.&rdquo;<br>

he has desired her for his habitation:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	&ldquo;This shall be my resting-place for ever; *<br>
here will I dwell, for I delight in her.<br>
<strong>16	I will surely bless her provisions, *<br>
and satisfy her poor with bread.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	I will clothe her priests with salvation, *<br>
and her faithful people will rejoice and sing.<br>
<strong>18	There will I make the horn of David flourish; *<br>
I have prepared a lamp for my Anointed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	As for his enemies, I will clothe them with shame; *<br>
but as for him, his crown will shine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’ Jesus answered, ‘Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?’ Pilate replied, ‘I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?’ Jesus answered, ‘My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.’ Pilate asked him, ‘So you are a king?’ Jesus answered, ‘You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.’</p>
