<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Samuel 5:1-5,9-10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from second Samuel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, ‘Look, we are your bone and flesh. For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in. The Lord said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel.’ So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for forty years. At Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years. David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inwards. And David became greater and greater, for the Lord, the God of hosts, was with him.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 48</p>
<p><em>Magnus Dominus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; *<br>
in the city of our God is his holy hill.<br>
<strong>2	Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the hill of Zion, *<br>
the very center of the world and the city of the great King.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	God is in her citadels; *<br>
he is known to be her sure refuge.<br>
<strong>4	Behold, the kings of the earth assembled *<br>
and marched forward together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	They looked and were astounded; *<br>
they retreated and fled in terror.<br>
<strong>6	Trembling seized them there; *<br>
they writhed like a woman in childbirth,<br>
like ships of the sea when the east wind shatters them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	As we have heard, so have we seen,<br>
in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; *<br>
God has established her for ever.<br>
<strong>8	We have waited in silence on your loving-kindness, O God, *<br>
in the midst of your temple.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Corinthians 12:2-10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat. On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses. But if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me, even considering the exceptional character of the revelations. Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given to me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.’ So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He left that place and came to his home town, and his disciples followed him. On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, ‘Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?’ And they took offence at him. Then Jesus said to them, ‘Prophets are not without honour, except in their home town, and among their own kin, and in their own house.’ And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them. And he was amazed at their unbelief.</p>
<p>Then he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics. He said to them, ‘Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.’ So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent. They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.</p>

<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
