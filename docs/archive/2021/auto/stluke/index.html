<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Sirach.</p>
<p>Honour physicians for their services,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for the Lord created them;<br>
for their gift of healing comes from the Most High,<br>
and they are rewarded by the king.<br>
The skill of physicians makes them distinguished,<br>
and in the presence of the great they are admired.<br>
The Lord created medicines out of the earth,<br>
and the sensible will not despise them.<br>
And he gave skill to human beings<br>
that he might be glorified in his marvellous works.<br>
By them the physician heals and takes away pain;<br>
the pharmacist makes a mixture from them.<br>
God’s works will never be finished;<br>
and from him health spreads over all the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My child, when you are ill, do not delay,<br>
but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.<br>
Give up your faults and direct your hands rightly,<br>
and cleanse your heart from all sin.<br>
Then give the physician his place, for the Lord created him;<br>
do not let him leave you, for you need him.<br>
There may come a time when recovery lies in the hands of physicians,<br>
for they too pray to the Lord<br>
that he will grant them success in diagnosis<br>
and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1	Hallelujah!<br>
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *<br>
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!<br>
<strong>2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *<br>
he gathers the exiles of Israel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He heals the brokenhearted *<br>
and binds up their wounds.<br>
<strong>4	He counts the number of the stars *<br>

there is no limit to his wisdom.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, *<br>
but casts the wicked to the ground.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *<br>
make music to our God upon the harp.<br>
<strong>8	He covers the heavens with clouds *<br>
and prepares rain for the earth;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *<br>
and green plants to serve mankind.<br>
<strong>10	He provides food for flocks and herds *<br>
and for the young ravens when they cry.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *<br>
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;<br>
<strong>12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *<br>
in those who await his gracious favor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *<br>
praise your God, O Zion;<br>
<strong>14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; *<br>
he has blessed your children within you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	He has established peace on your borders; *<br>
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.<br>
<strong>16	He sends out his command to the earth, *<br>
and his word runs very swiftly.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	He gives snow like wool; *<br>
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.<br>
<strong>18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; *<br>
who can stand against his cold?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *<br>
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.<br>
<strong>20	He declares his word to Jacob, *<br>
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21	He has not done so to any other nation; *<br>
to them he has not revealed his judgments.<br>
Hallelujah!</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.</p>
<p>As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</p>
<p>Do your best to come to me soon, for Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.</p>

<p>Then Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.</p>
<p>When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
because he has anointed me<br>
to bring good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br>
and recovery of sight to the blind,<br>
to let the oppressed go free,<br>
to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.’<br>
And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, ‘Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.’</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
