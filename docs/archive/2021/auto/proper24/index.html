<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
<p>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?<br>
Gird up your loins like a man,<br>
I will question you, and you shall declare to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?<br>
Tell me, if you have understanding.<br>
Who determined its measurements—surely you know!<br>
Or who stretched the line upon it?<br>
On what were its bases sunk,<br>
or who laid its cornerstone<br>
when the morning stars sang together<br>
and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,<br>
so that a flood of waters may cover you?<br>
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go<br>
and say to you, “Here we are”?<br>
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts,<br>
or given understanding to the mind?<br>
Who has the wisdom to number the clouds?<br>
Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,<br>
when the dust runs into a mass<br>
and the clods cling together?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Can you hunt the prey for the lion,<br>
or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br>
when they crouch in their dens,<br>
or lie in wait in their covert?<br>
Who provides for the raven its prey,<br>
when its young ones cry to God,<br>
and wander about for lack of food?</p>

<strong>2	You wrap yourself with light as with a cloak *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-51-10_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 5:1-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness; and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not presume to take this honour, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
<p>So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You are my Son,<br>
today I have begotten you’;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as he says also in another place,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You are a priest for ever,<br>
according to the order of Melchizedek.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, ‘Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.’ And he said to them, ‘What is it you want me to do for you?’ And they said to him, ‘Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.’ But Jesus said to them, ‘You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?’ They replied, ‘We are able.’ Then Jesus said to them, ‘The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.’</p>
<p>When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, ‘You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.’</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

<p><strong>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
