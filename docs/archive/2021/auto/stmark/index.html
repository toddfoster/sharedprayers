<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 2</p>
<p><em>Quare fremuerunt gentes?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *<br>
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?<br>
<strong>2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,<br>
and the princes plot together, *<br>
against the LORD and against his Anointed?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	&ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&rdquo; they say; *<br>
&ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *<br>
the Lord has them in derision.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *<br>
and his rage fills them with terror.<br>
<strong>6	&ldquo;I myself have set my king *<br>
upon my holy hill of Zion.&quot;</strong></p>

your inheritance *<br>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Ephesians 4:7-8,11-16</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it is said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive;<br>
he gave gifts to his people.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knitted together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>
<em>Mark 1:1-15</em></p>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Mark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,<br>
who will prepare your way;<br>
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:<br>
“Prepare the way of the Lord,<br>
make his paths straight”’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, ‘The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.’</p>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‘You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.’</p>
<p>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.</p>
<p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.’</p>

<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
