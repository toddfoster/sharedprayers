Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;<br>

Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;<br>

<strong>2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,<br>

against the LORD and against his Anointed?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	&ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&rdquo; they say; *<br>
&ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>Each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ&rsquo;s gift. Therefore it is said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people&rsquo;s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body&rsquo;s growth in building itself up in love.</p>

<p>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;<br>
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: `Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, &ldquo;The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.</p>
<p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
