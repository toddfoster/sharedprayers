<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”</p>
<p>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.” Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!”</p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.</p>

<p>There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.” Jesus answered him, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can anyone be born after having grown old? Can one enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?</p>
<p>“Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen; yet you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</p>
<p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.</p>
<p>“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

(BCP, 457)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

I bind unto myself today<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I bind this day to me for ever,<br>
by power of faith, Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation;<br>
his baptism in the Jordan river;<br>
his death on cross for my salvation;<br>
his bursting from the spiced tomb;<br>
his riding up the heavenly way;<br>
his coming at the day of doom:<br>
I bind unto myself today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
I bind unto myself the power<br>
of the great love of cherubim;<br>
the sweet &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; in judgment hour;<br>
the service of the seraphim;<br>
confessors&rsquo; faith, apostles&rsquo; word,<br>
the patriarchs&rsquo; prayers, the prophets&rsquo; scrolls;<br>
all good deeds done unto the Lord,<br>
and purity of virgin souls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the virtues of the star-lit heaven<br>
the glorious sun&rsquo;s life-giving ray,<br>
the whiteness of the moon at even,<br>
the flashing of the lightning free,<br>
the whirling wind&rsquo;s tempestuous shocks,<br>
the stable earth, the deep salt sea,<br>
around the old eternal rocks.</p>

<p>5<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the power of God to hold and lead,<br>
his eye to watch, his might to stay,<br>
his ear to hearken, to my need;<br>
the wisdom of my God to teach,<br>
his hand to guide, his shield to ward;<br>
the word of God to give me speech,<br>
his heavenly host to be my guard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6<br>
Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br>
Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br>
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br>
Christ to comfort and restore me,<br>
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br>
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br>
Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br>
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</p>

I bind unto myself the Name,<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>

eternal Father, Spirit, Word:<br>
praise to the Lord of my salvation,<br>
