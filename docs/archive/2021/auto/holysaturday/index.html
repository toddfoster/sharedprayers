<blockquote>
<p>O God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and rested on this holy Sabbath, so we may await with him the coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.</p>

<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Job 14:1-14</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>comes up like a flower and withers,<br>
flees like a shadow and does not last.<br>
Do you fix your eyes on such a one?<br>
Do you bring me into judgement with you?<br>
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?<br>
No one can.<br>
Since their days are determined,<br>
and the number of their months is known to you,<br>
and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,<br>
look away from them, and desist,<br>
that they may enjoy, like labourers, their days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘For there is hope for a tree,<br>
if it is cut down, that it will sprout again,<br>
and that its shoots will not cease.<br>
Though its root grows old in the earth,<br>
and its stump dies in the ground,<br>
yet at the scent of water it will bud<br>
and put forth branches like a young plant.<br>
But mortals die, and are laid low;<br>
humans expire, and where are they?<br>
As waters fail from a lake,<br>
and a river wastes away and dries up,<br>
so mortals lie down and do not rise again;<br>
until the heavens are no more, they will not awake<br>
or be roused out of their sleep.<br>
O that you would hide me in Sheol,<br>
that you would conceal me until your wrath is past,<br>
that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!<br>
If mortals die, will they live again?<br>
All the days of my service I would wait<br>
until my release should come.</p>

<p>Lector:</p>

<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 31:1-4,15-16</p>
<p><em>In te, Domine, speravi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge;<br>
let me never be put to shame; *<br>
deliver me in your righteousness.<br>
<strong>2 Incline your ear to me; *<br>
make haste to deliver me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,<br>
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *<br>
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.<br>
<strong>4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *<br>
for you are my tower of strength.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 My times are in your hand; *<br>
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,<br>
and from those who persecute me.<br>
<strong>16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *<br>
and in your loving-kindness save me.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Peter 4:1-8</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an account to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.</p>
<p>The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>
<em>Matthew 27:57-66</em></p>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
<p>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, ‘Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, “After three days I will rise again.” Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, “He has been raised from the dead”, and the last deception would be worse than the first.’ Pilate said to them, ‘You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.’ So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the midst of life we are in death;<br>
of whom may we seek for succor,<br>
but of thee, O Lord,<br>
who for our sins art justly displeased?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,<br>
O holy and most merciful Savior,<br>
deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;<br>
shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer;<br>
but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty,<br>
O holy and merciful Savior,<br>
thou most worthy Judge eternal.<br>
Suffer us not, at our last hour,<br>
through any pains of death, to fall from thee.</p>

Give us this day our daily bread.<br>

for ever and ever.  Amen.</strong></p>
