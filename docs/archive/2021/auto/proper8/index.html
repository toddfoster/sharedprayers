<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Samuel 1:1,7-27</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from second Samuel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, “Here, sir.” And he said to me, “Who are you?” I answered him, “I am an Amalekite.” He said to me, “Come, stand over me and kill me; for convulsions have seized me, and yet my life still lingers.” So I stood over him, and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.’</p>
<p>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did the same. They mourned and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for his son Jonathan, and for the army of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. David said to the young man who had reported to him, ‘Where do you come from?’ He answered, ‘I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite.’ David said to him, ‘Were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?’ Then David called one of the young men and said, ‘Come here and strike him down.’ So he struck him down and he died. David said to him, ‘Your blood be on your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, “I have killed the Lord’s anointed.”’</p>
<p>David intoned this lamentation over Saul and his son Jonathan. (He ordered that The Song of the Bow be taught to the people of Judah; it is written in the Book of Jashar.) He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your glory, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places!<br>
How the mighty have fallen!<br>
Tell it not in Gath,<br>
proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon;<br>
or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,<br>
the daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You mountains of Gilboa,<br>
let there be no dew or rain upon you,<br>
nor bounteous fields!<br>
For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,<br>
the shield of Saul, anointed with oil no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the blood of the slain,<br>
from the fat of the mighty,<br>
the bow of Jonathan did not turn back,<br>
nor the sword of Saul return empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely!<br>
In life and in death they were not divided;<br>
they were swifter than eagles,<br>
they were stronger than lions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,<br>
who clothed you with crimson, in luxury,<br>
who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How the mighty have fallen<br>
in the midst of the battle!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan lies slain upon your high places.<br>
I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;<br>
greatly beloved were you to me;<br>
your love to me was wonderful,<br>
passing the love of women.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How the mighty have fallen,<br>
and the weapons of war perished!</p>

LORD, hear my voice; *<br>
let your ears consider well the voice of my supplication.<br>
<strong>2	If you, LORD, were to note what is done amiss, *<br>
O LORD, who could stand?</strong></p>

<p>3	For there is forgiveness with you; *<br>
therefore you shall be feared.<br>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Corinthians 8:7-15</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in utmost eagerness, and in our love for you—so we want you to excel also in this generous undertaking.</p>
<p>I do not say this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love against the earnestness of others. For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich. And in this matter I am giving my advice: it is appropriate for you who began last year not only to do something but even to desire to do something— now finish doing it, so that your eagerness may be matched by completing it according to your means. For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has—not according to what one does not have. I do not mean that there should be relief for others and pressure on you, but it is a question of a fair balance between your present abundance and their need, so that their abundance may be for your need, in order that there may be a fair balance. As it is written,</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>

<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Mark.</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered round him; and he was by the lake. Then one of the leaders of the synagogue named Jairus came and, when he saw him, fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly, ‘My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.’ So he went with him.</p>
<p>And a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him. Now there was a woman who had been suffering from haemorrhages for twelve years. She had endured much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had; and she was no better, but rather grew worse. She had heard about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, for she said, ‘If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well.’ Immediately her haemorrhage stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. Immediately aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, ‘Who touched my clothes?’ And his disciples said to him, ‘You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say, “Who touched me?”’ He looked all round to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. He said to her, ‘Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.’</p>
<p>While he was still speaking, some people came from the leader’s house to say, ‘Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further?’ But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue, ‘Do not fear, only believe.’ He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. When they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue, he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. When he had entered, he said to them, ‘Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.’ And they laughed at him. Then he put them all outside, and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, ‘Talitha cum’, which means, ‘Little girl, get up!’ And immediately the girl got up and began to walk about (she was twelve years of age). At this they were overcome with amazement. He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
