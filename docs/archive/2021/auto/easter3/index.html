<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter addressed the people, “You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</p>
<p>“And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out.”</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John.</p>
<p>See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p>
<p>Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.</p>

<p>Jesus stood among the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.</p>
<p>Then he said to them, &ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>

and you have fed us with spiritual food<br>
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.<br>
Send us now into the world in peace,<br>
and grant us strength and courage<br>
to love and serve you<br>
with gladness and singleness of heart;<br>
through Christ our Lord. Amen.</strong></p>

<p><em>I Love to Tell the Story</em> (LEVAS 64)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
I love to tell the story<br>
Of unseen things above,<br>
Of Jesus and His glory,<br>
Of Jesus and His love.<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
Because I know it’s true;<br>
It satisfies my longings<br>
As nothing else would do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Refrain:<br>
I love to tell the story;<br>
Twill be my theme in glory.<br>
To tell the old, old story<br>
Of Jesus and His love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
For those who know it best<br>
Seem hungering and thirsting<br>
To hear it, like the rest.<br>
And when, in scenes of glory,<br>
I sing the new, new song,<br>
’Twill be the old, old story<br>
That I have loved so long. (refrain)</p>
</blockquote>
