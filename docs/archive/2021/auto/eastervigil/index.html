<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back. As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.” So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</p>

<p>Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried<br>
with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to<br>
newness of life. I call upon you, therefore, now that our<br>
Lenten observance is ended, to renew the solemn promises<br>
and vows of Holy Baptism, by which we once renounced<br>
Satan and all his works, and promised to serve God faithfully<br>
in his holy Catholic Church.</p></blockquote>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
<h5 id="presider-26">Presider:</h5>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="if-a-person-desires-to-receive-the-sacrament-but-by-reason-of-extreme-sickness-or-physical-disability-is-unable-to-eat-and-drink-the-bread-and-wine-the-celebrant-is-to-assure-that-person-that-all-the-benefits-of-communion-are-received-even-though-the-sacrament-is-not-received-with-the-mouth-bcp-457">If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
