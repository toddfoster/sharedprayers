<p>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”</p>

<p><em>Eructavit cor meum</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	My heart is stirring with a noble song;<br>
let me recite what I have fashioned for the king; *<br>
my tongue shall be the pen of a skilled writer.<br>
<strong>2	You are the fairest of men; *<br>
grace flows from your lips,<br>
because God has blessed you for ever.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Strap your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior, *<br>
in your pride and in your majesty.<br>
<strong>4	Ride out and conquer in the cause of truth *<br>
and for the sake of justice.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Your right hand will show you marvelous things; *<br>
your arrows are very sharp, O mighty warrior.<br>
<strong>6	The peoples are falling at your feet, *<br>
and the king&rsquo;s enemies are losing heart.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever, *<br>
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom;<br>
you love righteousness and hate iniquity.<br>
<strong>8	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you *<br>
with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, *<br>
and the music of strings from ivory palaces makes you glad.<br>
<strong>10	Kings&rsquo; daughters stand among the ladies of the court; *<br>
on your right hand is the queen,<br>
adorned with the gold of Ophir.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	&ldquo;Hear, O daughter; consider and listen closely; *<br>
forget your people and your father&rsquo;s house.<br>
<strong>12	The king will have pleasure in your beauty; *<br>
he is your master; therefore do him honor.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	The people of Tyre are here with a gift; *<br>
the rich among the people seek your favor.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>14	All glorious is the princess as she enters; *<br>
her gown is cloth-of-gold.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	In embroidered apparel she is brought to the king; *<br>
after her the bridesmaids follow in procession.<br>
<strong>16	With joy and gladness they are brought, *<br>
and enter into the palace of the king.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	&ldquo;In place of fathers, O king, you shall have sons; *<br>
you shall make them princes over all the earth.<br>
<strong>18	I will make your name to be remembered<br>
from one generation to another; *<br>
therefore nations will praise you for ever and ever.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-hebrews-104-10">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 10:4-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;<br>
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.<br>
Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).”</p></blockquote>
<p>When he said above, &ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p></blockquote>
