did not regard equality with God<br>
as something to be exploited,<br>
but emptied himself,<br>
taking the form of a slave,<br>
being born in human likeness.<br>
And being found in human form,<br>
he humbled himself<br>
and became obedient to the point of death—<br>
even death on a cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore God also highly exalted him<br>
and gave him the name<br>
that is above every name,<br>
so that at the name of Jesus<br>
every knee should bend,<br>
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
and every tongue should confess<br>
that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.’ He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, ‘We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?’ Jesus said to them, ‘The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.’</p>
<p>After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.</p>
