<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Wisdom of Solomon.</p>
<p>The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, 				and no torment will ever touch them. 				In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, 				and their departure was thought to be a disaster, 				and their going from us to be their destruction; 				but they are at peace. 				For though in the sight of others they were punished, 				their hope is full of immortality. 				Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, 				because God tested them and found them worthy of himself; 				like gold in the furnace he tried them, 				and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them. 				In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, 				and will run like sparks through the stubble. 				They will govern nations and rule over peoples, 				and the Lord will reign over them forever. 				Those who trust in him will understand truth, 				and the faithful will abide with him in love, 				because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones, 			and he watches over his elect.</p>

<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. 				He will dwell with them as their God; 				they will be his peoples, 				and God himself will be with them; 				he will wipe every tear from their eyes. 				Death will be no more; 				mourning and crying and pain will be no more, 					for the first things have passed away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the one who was seated on the throne said, &ldquo;See, I am making all things new.&rdquo; Also he said, &ldquo;Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, &ldquo;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&rdquo; When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. He said, &ldquo;Where have you laid him?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Lord, come and see.&rdquo; Jesus began to weep. So the Jews said, &ldquo;See how he loved him!&rdquo; But some of them said, &ldquo;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. Jesus said, &ldquo;Take away the stone.&rdquo; Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &ldquo;Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?&rdquo; So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank you for having heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.&rdquo; When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&rdquo;</p>

Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.<br>
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage<br>
in Egypt into the land of promise. In it your Son Jesus<br>
received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy<br>
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death<br>
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.<br>
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are<br>
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his<br>
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.<br>
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his<br>
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in<br>
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,<br>

Hosanna in the highest.<br>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-2"><strong>Celebrant and People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>We praise you, we bless you,<br>
we give thanks to you,<br>
and we pray to you, Lord our God.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-2">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>Remember the newly baptized of this and every parish, especially Peyton, Addie, Gage, and James.</p>
<p>Remember Archbishop Welby, Presiding Bishop Curry, our Bishop Stokes, and all who minister in your Church.</p>
<p>Remember the Diocese of New Jersey Bishop Search committee, and the person you will bring to them to lead our Diocese through this next season of our life together.</p>
<p>Remember all your people, and those who seek your truth.</p>
<p>Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light. Remember especially those lost to us in the last year or so, including Kathy, Ryan, Nelson, Joan, Helen, Sandy, Joanne, Pat, Margie, Dale, Tina, Jackie, Ryan, Destiny, Dan, Evelyn, Angie, Nikol, Russel, Catherine, Jimmie, Patty, Bill, Linda, and Virginia.</p>
<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.</p>
