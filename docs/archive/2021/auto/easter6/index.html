<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said, &ldquo;Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&rdquo; So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John.</p>
<p>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith. Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p>This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said to his disciples, “As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.</p>
<p>“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.”</p>

<p><em>What a Friend We Have in Jesus</em> (LEVAS 109)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 What a friend we have in Jesus,<br>
All our sins and griefs to bear!<br>
What a privilege to carry<br>
Ev’rything to God in prayer!<br>
Oh, what peace we often forfeit,<br>
Oh, what needless pain we bear,<br>
All because we do not carry<br>
Ev’rything to God in prayer!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Have we trials and temptations?<br>
Is there trouble anywhere?<br>
We should never be discouraged,<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br>
Can we find a friend so faithful<br>
who will all our sorrows share?<br>
Jesus knows our ev’ry weakness,<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Are we weak and heavy laden,<br>
Cumbered with a load of care?<br>
Precious Savior, still our refuge,<br>
Take it to the Lord in Prayer.<br>
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?<br>
Take it to the Lord in Prayer.<br>
In his arms He’ll take and shield thee,<br>
Thou wilt find a solace there.</p></blockquote>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<p><em>In Christ There Is No East or West</em> (LEVAS 62)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 In Christ there is no East or West,<br>
in him no South or North,<br>
but one great fellowship of love<br>
throughout the whole wide earth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 In Christ shall true hearts ev’rywhere<br>
their high communion find.<br>
His service is the golden cord<br>
close binding humankind.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Join hands, disciples of the faith,<br>
whate’er your race may be.<br>
Who serves my Father as a son<br>
Is surely kin to me.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 In Christ now meet both East and West,<br>
in him meet South and North.<br>
All Christly souls are one in him<br>
throughout the whole wide earth.</p></blockquote>
