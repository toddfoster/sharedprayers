<p>Job said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Today also my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning.<br>
Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his dwelling!<br>
I would lay my case before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<br>
I would learn what he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.<br>
Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; but he would give heed to me.<br>
There an upright person could reason with him, and I should be acquitted forever by my judge.<br>
&ldquo;If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him;<br>
on the left he hides, and I cannot behold him; I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.<br>
God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me;<br>
If only I could vanish in darkness, and thick darkness would cover my face!&rdquo;</p>

<p>1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *<br>
and are so far from my cry<br>
and from the words of my distress?<br>
<strong>2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *<br>
by night as well, but I find no rest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Yet you are the Holy One, *<br>
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.<br>

they trusted, and you delivered them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *<br>

scorned by all and despised by the people.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *<br>
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,<br>
<strong>8	&ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *<br>
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *<br>
and kept me safe upon my mother&rsquo;s breast.<br>
<strong>10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *<br>
you were my God when I was still in my mother&rsquo;s womb.</strong></p>

<p>11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *<br>
and there is none to help.<br>

strong bulls of Bashan surround me.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13	They open wide their jaws at me, *<br>

my heart within my breast is melting wax.</strong></p>

my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-412-16_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 4:12-16</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.</p>
<p>Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.’” He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.” Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.</p>
<p>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” They were greatly astounded and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.”</p>
<p>Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.” Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

<p><strong>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>

For us and for our salvation<br>
he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Today the response to the prompt, &ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, <strong>“Hear our prayer.”</strong> The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is <strong>“To you, O Lord.”</strong></p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<h5 id="presider-4">Presider:</h5>
