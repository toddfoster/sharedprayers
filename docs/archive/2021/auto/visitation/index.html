<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Samuel 2:1-10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from first Samuel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hannah prayed and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘My heart exults in the Lord;<br>
my strength is exalted in my God.<br>
My mouth derides my enemies,<br>
because I rejoice in my victory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘There is no Holy One like the Lord,<br>
no one besides you;<br>
there is no Rock like our God.<br>
Talk no more so very proudly,<br>
let not arrogance come from your mouth;<br>
for the Lord is a God of knowledge,<br>
and by him actions are weighed.<br>
The bows of the mighty are broken,<br>
but the feeble gird on strength.<br>
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,<br>
but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.<br>
The barren has borne seven,<br>
but she who has many children is forlorn.<br>
The Lord kills and brings to life;<br>
he brings down to Sheol and raises up.<br>
The Lord makes poor and makes rich;<br>
he brings low, he also exalts.<br>
He raises up the poor from the dust;<br>
he lifts the needy from the ash heap,<br>
to make them sit with princes<br>
and inherit a seat of honour.<br>
For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s,<br>
and on them he has set the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,<br>
but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness;<br>
for not by might does one prevail.<br>
The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered;<br>
the Most High will thunder in heaven.<br>
The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;<br>
he will give strength to his king,<br>
and exalt the power of his anointed.’</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 113</p>
<p><em>Laudate, pueri</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Hallelujah!<br>
Give praise, you servants of the LORD; *<br>
praise the Name of the LORD.<br>
<strong>2	Let the Name of the LORD be blessed, *<br>
from this time forth for evermore.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honour. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.</p>
<p>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>
<em>Luke 1:39-57</em></p>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leapt in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.’</p>
<p>And Mary said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,<br>
for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.<br>
Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br>
for the Mighty One has done great things for me,<br>
and holy is his name.<br>
His mercy is for those who fear him<br>
from generation to generation.<br>
He has shown strength with his arm;<br>
he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.<br>
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,<br>
and lifted up the lowly;<br>
he has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
and sent the rich away empty.<br>
He has helped his servant Israel,<br>
in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
according to the promise he made to our ancestors,<br>
to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mary remained with her for about three months and then returned to her home.</p>
<p>Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
