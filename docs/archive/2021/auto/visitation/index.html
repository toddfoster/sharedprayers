<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from first Samuel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hannah prayed and said,<br>
“My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in my God.<br>
There is no Holy One like the LORD, no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.<br>
Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth;<br>
for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<br>
The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.<br>
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.<br>
The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.<br>
The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.<br>
The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.<br>
He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap,<br>
to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor.<br>
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD&rsquo;s, and on them he has set the world.<br>
He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might does one prevail.<br>
The LORD! His adversaries shall be shattered; the Most High will thunder in heaven.<br>
The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.</p>
<p>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.</p>

<p>In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mary said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br>
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;<br>
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.<br>
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.<br>
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.<br>
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;<br>
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.<br>
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p></blockquote>
