<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Job 42:1-6,10-17</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Job answered the Lord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I know that you can do all things,<br>
and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.<br>
“Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?”<br>
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br>
things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.<br>
“Hear, and I will speak;<br>
I will question you, and you declare to me.”<br>
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<br>
but now my eye sees you;<br>
therefore I despise myself,<br>
and repent in dust and ashes.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring. The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. After this Job lived for one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations. And Job died, old and full of days.</p>

<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 34:1-8,(19-22)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This reading can be found at <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?version=NRSVAE&amp;passage=Psalm%2034:1-8,(19-22)">Psalm 34:1-8,(19-22)</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Hebrews 7:23-28</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues for ever. Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p>
<p>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.</p>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Jesus stood still and said, ‘Call him here.’ And they called the blind man, saying to him, ‘Take heart; get up, he is calling you.’ So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. Then Jesus said to him, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ The blind man said to him, ‘My teacher, let me see again.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Go; your faith has made you well.’ Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.</p>
