Do not let them escape from your sight;<br>

For they are life to those who find them,<br>

Keep your heart with all vigilance,<br>

Put away from you crooked speech,<br>
and put devious talk far from you.<br>
Let your eyes look directly forwards,<br>
and your gaze be straight before you.<br>
Keep straight the path of your feet,<br>
and all your ways will be sure.<br>
Do not swerve to the right or to the left;<br>
turn your foot away from evil.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-galatians-322-28">The Second Lesson: <em>Galatians 3:22-28</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p>
<p>Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.</p>

for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.<br>
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.<br>
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.<br>
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;<br>
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.<br>
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

(BCP, 457)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
