<blockquote>
<p>Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>let the earth hear the words of my mouth.<br>

like gentle rain on grass,<br>
like showers on new growth.<br>
For I will proclaim the name of the Lord;<br>
ascribe greatness to our God!</p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Ephesians 2:13-22</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, so that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling-place for God.</p>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.</p>
<p>‘If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you. If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world—therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, “Servants are not greater than their master.” If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. It was to fulfil the word that is written in their law, “They hated me without a cause.”</p>
<p>‘When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.</p>
