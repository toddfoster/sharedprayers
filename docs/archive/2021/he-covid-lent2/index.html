<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless. And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous.” Then Abram fell on his face; and God said to him, “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.</p>
<p>God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”</p>

<p>22 Praise the Lord, you that fear him; *<br>
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;<br>
all you of Jacob&rsquo;s line, give glory.<br>
<strong>23 For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;<br>
neither does he hide his face from them; *<br>
but when they cry to him he hears them.</strong></p>
<p>24 My praise is of him in the great assembly; *<br>
I will perform my vows<br>
in the presence of those who worship him.<br>
<strong>25 The poor shall eat and be satisfied,<br>
and those who seek the Lord shall praise him: *<br>
&ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>26 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, *<br>
and all the families of the nations shall bow before him.<br>
<strong>27 For kingship belongs to the Lord; *<br>
he rules over the nations.</strong></p>
<p>28 To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *<br>
all who go down to the dust fall before him.<br>
<strong>29 My soul shall live for him;<br>
my descendants shall serve him; *<br>
they shall be known as the Lord’s for ever.</strong></p>
<p>30 They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *<br>
the saving deeds that he has done.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_romans-413-25_">The Second Lesson: <em>Romans 4:13-25</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.</p>
<p>For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.” He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. Therefore his faith “was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.</p>

<p>Jesus began to teach his disciples that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”</p>
<p>He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”</p>

thy kingdom come,<br>
thy will be done,<br>
on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
And lead us not into temptation,<br>
but deliver us from evil.<br>
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,<br>
for ever and ever.  Amen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

<p><em>Lift Every Voice and Sing</em> (LEVAS 1)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Lift ev’ry voice and sing,<br>
Till earth and heaven ring,<br>
Ring with the harmonies of liberty;<br>
Let our rejoicing rise<br>
High as the list’ning skies,<br>
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.<br>
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us;<br>
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;<br>
Facing the rising sun<br>
Of our new day begun,<br>
Let us march on till victory is won.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
Stony the road we trod,<br>
Bitter the chast’ning rod,<br>
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;<br>
Yet with a steady beat,<br>
Have not our weary feet<br>
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br>
We have come over away that with tears has been watered;<br>
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered;<br>
Out from the gloomy past,<br>
Till now we stand at last<br>
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
God of our weary years,<br>
God of our silent tears,<br>
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;<br>
Thou who hast by thy might,<br>
Led us into the light,<br>
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.<br>
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee;<br>
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee,<br>
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,<br>
May we forever stand,<br>
True to our God, true to our native land.</p>
