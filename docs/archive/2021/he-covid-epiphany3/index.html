<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Jonah 3:1-5, 10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Jonah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying, “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days&rsquo; walk across. Jonah began to go into the city, going a day&rsquo;s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 62:6-14<br>
<em>Nonne Deo?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 For God alone my soul in silence waits; *<br>
truly, my hope is in him.<br>
<strong>7 He alone is my rock and my salvation, *<br>
my stronghold, so that I shall not be shaken.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8 In God is my safety and my honor; *<br>
God is my strong rock and my refuge.<br>
<strong>9 Put your trust in him always, O people, *<br>
pour out your hearts before him, for God is our refuge.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10 Those of high degree are but a fleeting breath, *<br>
even those of low estate cannot be trusted.<br>
<strong>11 On the scales they are lighter than a breath, *<br>
all of them together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>12 Put no trust in extortion; in robbery take no empty pride; *<br>
though wealth increase, set not your heart upon it.<br>
<strong>13 God has spoken once, twice have I heard it, *<br>
that power belongs to God.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short; from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no possessions, and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you fish for people.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>

<p><em>Christ for the world we sing!</em> (Hymnal 537)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with loving zeal;<br>
the poor and them that mourn,<br>
the faint and overborne,<br>
sin-sick and sorrow-worn,<br>
whom Christ doth heal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with fervent prayer;<br>
the wayward and the lost,<br>
by restless passions tossed,<br>
redeemed at countless cost,<br>
from dark despair.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with one accord;<br>
with us the work to share,<br>
with us reproach to dare,<br>
with us the cross to bear,<br>
for Christ our Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with joyful song;<br>
the newborn souls, whose days,<br>
reclaimed from error&rsquo;s ways,<br>
inspired with hope and praise,<br>
to Christ belong.</p>
