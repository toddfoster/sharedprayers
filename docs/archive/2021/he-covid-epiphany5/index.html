<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Have you not known? Have you not heard?<br>
Has it not been told you from the beginning?<br>
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>
<p>It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,<br>
and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;<br>
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,<br>
and spreads them like a tent to live in;<br>
who brings princes to naught,<br>
and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.</p>
<p>Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,<br>
scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,<br>
when he blows upon them, and they wither,<br>
and the tempest carries them off like stubble.</p>
<p>To whom then will you compare me,<br>
or who is my equal? says the Holy One.</p>
<p>Lift up your eyes on high and see:<br>
Who created these?</p>
<p>He who brings out their host and numbers them,<br>
calling them all by name;<br>
because he is great in strength,<br>
mighty in power,<br>
not one is missing.</p>
<p>Why do you say, O Jacob,<br>
and speak, O Israel,<br>
&ldquo;My way is hidden from the Lord,<br>
and my right is disregarded by my God&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Have you not known? Have you not heard?<br>
The Lord is the everlasting God,<br>
the Creator of the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>He does not faint or grow weary;<br>
his understanding is unsearchable.<br>
He gives power to the faint,<br>
and strengthens the powerless.</p>
<p>Even youths will faint and be weary,<br>
and the young will fall exhausted;<br>
but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength,<br>
they shall mount up with wings like eagles,<br>
they shall run and not be weary,<br>
they shall walk and not faint.</p>

<p><em>Laudate Dominum</em></p>
<p>1 Hallelujah!<br>
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *<br>
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!<br>
<strong>2 The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem; *<br>
he gathers the exiles of Israel.</strong></p>
<p>3 He heals the brokenhearted *<br>
and binds up their wounds.<br>
<strong>4 He counts the number of the stars *<br>
and calls them all by their names.</strong></p>
<p>5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power; *<br>
there is no limit to his wisdom.<br>
<strong>6 The Lord lifts up the lowly, *<br>
but casts the wicked to the ground.</strong></p>
<p>7 Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; *<br>
make music to our God upon the harp.<br>
<strong>8 He covers the heavens with clouds *<br>
and prepares rain for the earth;</strong></p>
<p>9 He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *<br>
and green plants to serve mankind.<br>
<strong>10 He provides food for flocks and herds *<br>
and for the young ravens when they cry.</strong></p>
<p>11 He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *<br>
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;<br>
<strong>12 But the Lord has pleasure in those who fear him, *<br>
in those who await his gracious favor.<br>
21 Hallelujah!</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-916-23_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 9:16-23</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel! For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.<br>
For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law) so that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.</p>

<p>After Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</p>
<p>That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered around the door. And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed. And Simon and his companions hunted for him. When they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you.” He answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.” And he went throughout Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.</p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Christ has died.<br>
Christ is risen.<br>
Christ will come again.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Presider continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

Ring with the harmonies of liberty;<br>

High as the list’ning skies,<br>

Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;<br>

Bitter the chast’ning rod,<br>
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;<br>
Yet with a steady beat,<br>
Have not our weary feet<br>
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br>
We have come over away that with tears has been watered;<br>
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered;<br>
Out from the gloomy past,<br>
Till now we stand at last<br>
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.</p>

<p>3<br>
God of our weary years,<br>
God of our silent tears,<br>
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;<br>
Thou who hast by thy might,<br>
Led us into the light,<br>
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.<br>
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee;<br>
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee,<br>
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,<br>
May we forever stand,<br>
True to our God, true to our native land.</p>
