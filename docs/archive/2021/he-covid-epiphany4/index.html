<em>Deuteronomy 18:15-20</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moses said: The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the Lord my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the Lord replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command. Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable. But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak—that prophet shall die.”</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 111</p>
<p><em>Confitebor tibi</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Hallelujah!<br>
I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, *<br>
in the assembly of the upright, in the congregation.<br>
<strong>2	Great are the deeds of the LORD! *<br>
they are studied by all who delight in them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	His work is full of majesty and splendor, *<br>
and his righteousness endures for ever.<br>
<strong>4	He makes his marvelous works to be remembered; *<br>
the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He gives food to those who fear him; *<br>
he is ever mindful of his covenant.<br>
<strong>6	He has shown his people the power of his works *<br>
in giving them the lands of the nations.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; *<br>
all his commandments are sure.<br>
<strong>8	They stand fast for ever and ever, *<br>
because they are done in truth and equity.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	He sent redemption to his people;<br>
he commanded his covenant for ever; *<br>
holy and awesome is his Name.<br>
<strong>10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; *<br>
those who act accordingly have a good understanding;<br>
his praise endures for ever.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Corinthians 8:1-13</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge; but anyone who loves God is known by him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “no idol in the world really exists,” and that “there is no God but one.” Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as in fact there are many gods and many lords— yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge. Since some have become so accustomed to idols until now, they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. “Food will not bring us close to God.” We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For if others see you, who possess knowledge, eating in the temple of an idol, might they not, since their conscience is weak, be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols? So by your knowledge those weak believers for whom Christ died are destroyed. But when you thus sin against members of your family, and wound their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food is a cause of their falling, I will never eat meat, so that I may not cause one of them to fall.</p>

<p>Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.” But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
