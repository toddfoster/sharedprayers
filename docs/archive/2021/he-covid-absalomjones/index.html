and spirit to those who walk in it:</p>
<p>I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,<br>
I have taken you by the hand and kept you;</p>
<p>I have given you as a covenant to the people,<br>
a light to the nations,<br>
to open the eyes that are blind,</p>
<p>to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,<br>
from the prison those who sit in darkness.</p>
<p>I am the Lord, that is my name;<br>
my glory I give to no other,<br>
nor my praise to idols.</p>
<p>See, the former things have come to pass,<br>
and new things I now declare;</p>
<p>before they spring forth,<br>
I tell you of them.</p>

<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
