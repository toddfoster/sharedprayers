<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God has given me<br>
the tongue of a teacher,<br>
that I may know how to sustain<br>
the weary with a word.<br>
Morning by morning he wakens—<br>
wakens my ear<br>
to listen as those who are taught.<br>
The Lord God has opened my ear,<br>
and I was not rebellious,<br>
I did not turn backwards.<br>
I gave my back to those who struck me,<br>
and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;<br>
I did not hide my face<br>
from insult and spitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God helps me;<br>
therefore I have not been disgraced;<br>
therefore I have set my face like flint,<br>
and I know that I shall not be put to shame;<br>

Who will contend with me?<br>
Let us stand up together.<br>
Who are my adversaries?<br>
Let them confront me.<br>
It is the Lord God who helps me;<br>
who will declare me guilty?<br>
All of them will wear out like a garment;<br>
the moth will eat them up.</p>

<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>

He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>

<p>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
<p>Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.</p>

<p><strong>The Third Lesson</strong><br>
<em>John 13:21-32</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After saying this Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, ‘Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.’ The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, ‘Lord, who is it?’ Jesus answered, ‘It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.’ So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, ‘Do quickly what you are going to do.’ Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, ‘Buy what we need for the festival’; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>
<p>When he had gone out, Jesus said, ‘Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.</p>
