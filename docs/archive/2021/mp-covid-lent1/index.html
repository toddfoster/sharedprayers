<p>God said to Noah and to his sons with him, “As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”</p>

<p><strong>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, *<br>
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br>
and of all their righteous offspring:<br>
You made the heavens and the earth, *<br>
with all their vast array.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All things quake with fear at your presence; *<br>
they tremble because of your power.<br>
But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; *<br>
it surpasses all that our minds can fathom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>O Lord, you are full of compassion, *<br>
long-suffering, and abounding in mercy.<br>
You hold back your hand; *<br>
you do not punish as we deserve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your great goodness, Lord,<br>
you have promised forgiveness to sinners, *<br>
that they may repent of their sin and be saved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, *<br>
and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness.<br>
I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, *<br>
and I know my wickedness only too well.<br>
Therefore I make this prayer to you: *<br>
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.<br>
Do not let me perish in my sin, *<br>
nor condemn me to the depths of the earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, *<br>
and in me you will show forth your goodness.<br>
Unworthy as I am, you will save me,<br>
in accordance with your great mercy, *<br>
and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life.<br>
For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, *<br>
and yours is the glory to ages of ages. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
<p>Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you&ndash; not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to him.</p>

<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”<br>
And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.<br>
Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”</p>
