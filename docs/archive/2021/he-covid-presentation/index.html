<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Malachi 3:1-4</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Malachi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the Lord, See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight&ndash; indeed, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For he is like a refiner&rsquo;s fire and like fullers&rsquo; soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the Lord in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 84</p>
<p><em>Quam dilecta!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *<br>
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;<br>
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.<br>
<strong>2	The sparrow has found her a house<br>
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *<br>
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,<br>
my King and my God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *<br>
they will always be praising you.<br>
<strong>4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *<br>
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&rsquo; way.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *<br>
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.<br>
<strong>6	They will climb from height to height, *<br>
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *<br>
hearken, O God of Jacob.<br>
<strong>8	Behold our defender, O God; *<br>
and look upon the face of your Anointed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	For one day in your courts is better than<br>
a thousand in my own room, *<br>
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God<br>
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br>
<strong>10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *<br>
he will give grace and glory;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Hebrews 2:14-18</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>

<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.</p>
<h5 id="people-3"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,<br>
according to your word;<br>
for my eyes have seen your salvation,<br>
which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>
a light for revelation to the Gentiles<br>
and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the child&rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</p>

<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
