<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Numbers 21:4-9</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From Mount Hor the Israelites set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; but the people became impatient on the way. The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.” So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 107:1-3, 17-22</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Confitemini Domino</em></p>
<p>1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, *<br>
and his mercy endures for ever.<br>
<strong>2 Let all those whom the Lord has redeemed proclaim *<br>
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.</strong></p>
<p>3 He gathered them out of the lands; *<br>
from the east and from the west,<br>
from the north and from the south.<br>
<strong>17 Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; *<br>
they were afflicted because of their sins.</strong></p>
<p>18 They abhorred all manner of food *<br>
and drew near to death&rsquo;s door.<br>
<strong>19 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, *<br>
and he delivered them from their distress.</strong></p>
<p>20 He sent forth his word and healed them *|<br>
and saved them from the grave.<br>
<strong>21 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his mercy *<br>
and the wonders he does for his children.</strong></p>
<p>22 Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving *<br>
and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Ephesians 2:1-10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient. All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ&ndash; by grace you have been saved&ndash; and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God&ndash; not the result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said, “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.<br>
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.<br>
“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed. But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”</p>

<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
