<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Genesis 1:1-5</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Genesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 29<br>
<em>Afferte Domino</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Ascribe to the Lord, you gods, *<br>
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.<br>
<strong>2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his Name; *<br>
worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters;<br>
the God of glory thunders; *<br>
the Lord is upon the mighty waters.<br>
<strong>4 The voice of the Lord is a powerful voice; *<br>
the voice of the Lord is a voice of splendor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedar trees; *<br>
the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon;<br>
<strong>6 He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *<br>
and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 The voice of the Lord splits the flames of fire;<br>
the voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; *<br>
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.<br>
<strong>8 The voice of the Lord makes the oak trees writhe *<br>
and strips the forests bare.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 And in the temple of the Lord *<br>
all are crying, &ldquo;Glory!&rdquo;<br>
<strong>10 The Lord sits enthroned above the flood; *<br>
the Lord sits enthroned as King for evermore.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 The Lord shall give strength to his people; *<br>
the Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.</p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Acts 19:1-7</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the interior regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples. He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” Then he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They answered, “Into John’s baptism.” Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.” On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied— altogether there were about twelve of them.</p>

<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Mark.</p>

<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>

<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>

<p><em>O love, how deep</em> (Hymnal 448)</p>
<p>1<br>
O love, how deep, how broad, how high,<br>
how passing thought and fantasy,<br>
that God, the Son of God, should take<br>
our mortal form for mortals&rsquo; sake!</p>
<p>2<br>
For us baptized, for us he bore<br>
his holy fast and hungered sore;<br>
for us temptations sharp he knew;<br>
for us the tempter overthrew.</p>
<p>3<br>
For us he prayed; for us he taught;<br>
for us his daily works he wrought:<br>
by words and signs and actions, thus<br>
still seeking not himself, but us.</p>
<p>4<br>
For us to wicked hands betrayed,<br>
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,<br>
he bore the shameful cross and death;<br>
for us gave up his dying breath.</p>
<p>5<br>
For us he rose from death again;<br>
for us he went on high to reign;<br>
for us he sent his Spirit here<br>
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.</p>
<p>6<br>
All glory to our Lord and God<br>
for love so deep, so high, so broad;<br>
the Trinity whom we adore<br>
forever and forevermore.</p>
