<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Hebrews 10:32–39</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting. Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For yet &ldquo;in a very little while,<br>
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;<br>
but my righteous one will live by faith.<br>
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong><br>
<strong>Psalm</strong> 124</p>
<p><em>Nisi quia Dominus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	If the LORD had not been on our side, *<br>
let Israel now say;<br>
<strong>2	If the LORD had not been on our side, *<br>
when enemies rose up against us;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Then would they have swallowed us up alive *<br>
in their fierce anger toward us;<br>
<strong>4	Then would the waters have overwhelmed us *<br>
and the torrent gone over us;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Then would the raging waters *<br>
have gone right over us.<br>
<strong>6	Blessed be the LORD! *<br>
he has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; *<br>
the snare is broken, and we have escaped.<br>
<strong>8	Our help is in the Name of the LORD, *<br>
the maker of heaven and earth.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus said, “They will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
