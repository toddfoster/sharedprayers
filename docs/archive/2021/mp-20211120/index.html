<em>Posuit flumina</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>33	The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *<br>
and water-springs into thirsty ground,<br>
<strong>34	A fruitful land into salt flats, *<br>
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>35	He changed deserts into pools of water *<br>
and dry land into water-springs.<br>
<strong>36	He settled the hungry there, *<br>
and they founded a city to dwell in.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>37	They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *<br>
and brought in a fruitful harvest.<br>
<strong>38	He blessed them, so that they increased greatly; *<br>
he did not let their herds decrease.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>39	Yet when they were diminished and brought low, *<br>
through stress of adversity and sorrow,<br>
<strong>40	(He pours contempt on princes *<br>
and makes them wander in trackless wastes)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>41	He lifted up the poor out of misery *<br>
and multiplied their families like flocks of sheep.<br>
<strong>42	The upright will see this and rejoice, *<br>
but all wickedness will shut its mouth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>43	Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *<br>
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1	My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; *<br>
I will sing and make melody.<br>
<strong>2	Wake up, my spirit;<br>
awake, lute and harp; *<br>
I myself will waken the dawn.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *<br>
I will sing praises to you among the nations.<br>
<strong>4	For your loving-kindness is greater than the heavens, *<br>
and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *<br>
and your glory over all the earth.<br>
<strong>6	So that those who are dear to you may be delivered, *<br>
save with your right hand and answer me.</strong></p>

you no longer go out, O God, with our armies.<br>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;<br>
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.<br>
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;<br>
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.<br>
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;<br>
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.<br>
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;<br>
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.<br>
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br>
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;<br>
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br>
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;<br>
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&ndash; and their descendants as well.<br>
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.<br>
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&ndash; its food shall be dust!<br>
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practises falsehood.</p>
<p>‘It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.’<br>
The Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come.’<br>
And let everyone who hears say, ‘Come.’<br>
And let everyone who is thirsty come.<br>
Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift.</p>
<p>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book; if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</p>
<p>The one who testifies to these things says, ‘Surely I am coming soon.’</p>
<p>Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</p>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-_matthew-1821-35_">The Third Lesson: <em>Matthew 18:21-35</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Peter came and said to Jesus, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?” Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.</p>
<p>“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’ Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’ And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”</p>
