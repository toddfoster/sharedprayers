<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_isaiah-491-7_">The First Lesson: <em>Isaiah 49:1-7</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Listen to me, O coastlands,<br>
pay attention, you peoples from far away!<br>
The Lord called me before I was born,<br>
while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.<br>
He made my mouth like a sharp sword,<br>
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br>
he made me a polished arrow,<br>
in his quiver he hid me away.<br>
And he said to me, ‘You are my servant,<br>
Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’<br>
But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain,<br>
I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;<br>
yet surely my cause is with the Lord,<br>
and my reward with my God.’</p>
<p>And now the Lord says,<br>
who formed me in the womb to be his servant,<br>
to bring Jacob back to him,<br>
and that Israel might be gathered to him,<br>
for I am honoured in the sight of the Lord,<br>
and my God has become my strength—<br>
he says,<br>
‘It is too light a thing that you should be my servant<br>
to raise up the tribes of Jacob<br>
and to restore the survivors of Israel;<br>
I will give you as a light to the nations,<br>
that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.’</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord,<br>
the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,<br>
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,<br>
the slave of rulers,<br>
‘Kings shall see and stand up,<br>
princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,<br>
because of the Lord, who is faithful,<br>
the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.’</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 15: The Song of Mary</strong> &ndash; <em>Magnificat</em> (Luke 1:46-55) (BCP 91)<br>
<strong>All:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-118-31_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 1:18-31</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,<br>
and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling-block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.</p>
<p>Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, ‘Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.’</p>

<strong>All:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-_john-1220-36_">The Third Lesson: <em>John 12:20-36</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, ‘Sir, we wish to see Jesus.’ Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, ‘The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honour.</p>
<p>‘Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—“Father, save me from this hour”? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.’ Then a voice came from heaven, ‘I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.’ The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, ‘An angel has spoken to him.’ Jesus answered, ‘This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.’ He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, ‘We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?’ Jesus said to them, ‘The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.’</p>
<p>After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.</p>
