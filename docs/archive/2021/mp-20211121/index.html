<strong>2	Let Israel now proclaim, *<br>
&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	Let those who fear the LORD now proclaim, *<br>
&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	I called to the LORD in my distress; *<br>
the LORD answered by setting me free.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD is at my side, therefore I will not fear; *<br>
what can anyone do to me?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The LORD is at my side to help me; *<br>
I will triumph over those who hate me.<br>
<strong>8	It is better to rely on the LORD *<br>
than to put any trust in flesh.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>11	They hem me in, they hem me in on every side; *<br>
in the name of the LORD I will repel them.<br>

<strong>14	The LORD is my strength and my song, *<br>
and he has become my salvation.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	There is a sound of exultation and victory *<br>

the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>

you are my God, and I will exalt you.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>On that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the centre of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at its border. It will be a sign and a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry to the Lord because of oppressors, he will send them a saviour, and will defend and deliver them. The Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians; and the Egyptians will know the Lord on that day, and will worship with sacrifice and burnt-offering, and they will make vows to the Lord and perform them. The Lord will strike Egypt, striking and healing; they will return to the Lord, and he will listen to their supplications and heal them.</p>
<p>On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.</p>
<p>On that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom the Lord of hosts has blessed, saying, ‘Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my heritage.’</p>

<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>

that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>

To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>

the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>

<p>After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened, and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, with golden sashes across their chests. Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever; and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.</p>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-1911-27">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 19:11-27</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>As they were listening to this, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. So he said, ‘A nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power for himself and then return. He summoned ten of his slaves, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, “Do business with these until I come back.” But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, “We do not want this man to rule over us.” When he returned, having received royal power, he ordered these slaves, to whom he had given the money, to be summoned so that he might find out what they had gained by trading. The first came forward and said, “Lord, your pound has made ten more pounds.” He said to him, “Well done, good slave! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.” Then the second came, saying, “Lord, your pound has made five pounds.” He said to him, “And you, rule over five cities.” Then the other came, saying, “Lord, here is your pound. I wrapped it up in a piece of cloth, for I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.” He said to him, “I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! You knew, did you, that I was a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when I returned, I could have collected it with interest.” He said to the bystanders, “Take the pound from him and give it to the one who has ten pounds.” (And they said to him, “Lord, he has ten pounds!”) “I tell you, to all those who have, more will be given; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.” ’</p>
