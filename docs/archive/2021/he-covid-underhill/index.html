<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Wisdom of Solomon 7:24–8:1</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the Wisdom of Solomon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For wisdom is more mobile than any motion;<br>
because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things.<br>
For she is a breath of the power of God,<br>
and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty;<br>
therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her.<br>
For she is a reflection of eternal light,<br>
a spotless mirror of the working of God,<br>
and an image of his goodness.<br>
Although she is but one, she can do all things,<br>
and while remaining in herself, she renews all things;<br>
in every generation she passes into holy souls<br>
and makes them friends of God, and prophets;<br>
for God loves nothing so much as the person who lives with wisdom.<br>
She is more beautiful than the sun,<br>
and excels every constellation of the stars.<br>
Compared with the light she is found to be superior,<br>
for it is succeeded by the night,<br>
but against wisdom evil does not prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other,<br>
and she orders all things well.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 37:3-6, 32-33</p>
<p><em>Noli aemulari</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Put your trust in the LORD and do good; *<br>
dwell in the land and feed on its riches.<br>
<strong>4	Take delight in the LORD, *<br>
and he shall give you your heart&rsquo;s desire.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, *<br>
and he will bring it to pass.<br>
<strong>6	He will make your righteousness as clear as the light *<br>
and your just dealing as the noonday.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>32	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, *<br>
and their tongue speaks what is right.<br>
<strong>33	The law of their God is in their heart, *<br>
and their footsteps shall not falter.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Corinthians 4:1–5</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they should be found trustworthy. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore do not pronounce judgement before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.</p>

<p>The woman said to Jesus, ‘Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.’</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn. Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically, hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</p>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
