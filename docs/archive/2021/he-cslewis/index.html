<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith&ndash; being more precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by fire&ndash; may be found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy, for you are receiving the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</p>

<p>1	LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *<br>
you know my sitting down and my rising up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.<br>
<strong>2	You trace my journeys and my resting-places *<br>
and are acquainted with all my ways.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *<br>
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.<br>
<strong>4	You press upon me behind and before *<br>
and lay your hand upon me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *<br>
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.<br>
<strong>6	Where can I go then from your Spirit? *<br>
where can I flee from your presence?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *<br>
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.<br>
<strong>8	If I take the wings of the morning *<br>
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Even there your hand will lead me *<br>
and your right hand hold me fast.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgement: about sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; about judgement, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.</p>
<p>‘I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
