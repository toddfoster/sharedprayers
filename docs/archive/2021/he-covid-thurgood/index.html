<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Amos.</p>
<p>They hate the one who reproves in the gate,<br>
and they abhor the one who speaks the truth.<br>
Therefore, because you trample on the poor<br>
and take from them levies of grain,<br>
you have built houses of hewn stone,<br>
but you shall not live in them;<br>
you have planted pleasant vineyards,<br>
but you shall not drink their wine.<br>
For I know how many are your transgressions,<br>
and how great are your sins—<br>
you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe,<br>
and push aside the needy in the gate.<br>
Therefore the prudent will keep silent in such a time;<br>
for it is an evil time.</p>
<p>Seek good and not evil,<br>
that you may live;<br>
and so the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you,<br>
just as you have said.<br>
Hate evil and love good,<br>
and establish justice in the gate;<br>
it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,<br>
will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p>I hate, I despise your festivals,<br>
and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.<br>
Even though you offer me your burnt-offerings and grain-offerings,<br>
I will not accept them;<br>
and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals<br>
I will not look upon.<br>
Take away from me the noise of your songs;<br>
I will not listen to the melody of your harps.<br>
But let justice roll down like waters,<br>
and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</p>

<p><em>Benedicam Dominum</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>15	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, *<br>
and his ears are open to their cry.<br>
<strong>16	The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, *<br>
to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them *<br>
and delivers them from all their troubles.<br>
<strong>18	The LORD is near to the brokenhearted *<br>
and will save those whose spirits are crushed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	Many are the troubles of the righteous, *<br>
but the LORD will deliver him out of them all.<br>
<strong>20	He will keep safe all his bones; *<br>
not one of them shall be broken.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21	Evil shall slay the wicked, *<br>
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.<br>
<strong>22	The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, *<br>
and none will be punished who trust in him.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-131-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 13:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast,* but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>
<p>Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>
<p>Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly,* but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, ‘The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; therefore, do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do, for they do not practise what they teach. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long. They love to have the place of honour at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the market-places, and to have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all students. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father—the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant.</p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
