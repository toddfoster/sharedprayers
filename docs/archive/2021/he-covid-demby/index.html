<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Malachi 2:5-7</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Malachi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My covenant with him was a covenant of life and well-being, which I gave him; this called for reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in integrity and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p><strong>The Psalm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 119:161-168</p>
<p><strong>Shin</strong><br>
<em>Principes persecuti sunt</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>161	Rulers have persecuted me without a cause, *<br>
but my heart stands in awe of your word.<br>
<strong>162	I am as glad because of your promise *<br>
as one who finds great spoils.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>163	As for lies, I hate and abhor them, *<br>
but your law is my love.<br>
<strong>164	Seven times a day do I praise you, *<br>
because of your righteous judgments.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>165	Great peace have they who love your law; *<br>
for them there is no stumbling block.<br>
<strong>166	I have hoped for your salvation, O LORD, *<br>
and have fulfilled your commandments.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>167	I have kept your decrees *<br>
and I have loved them deeply.<br>
<strong>168	I have kept your commandments and decrees, *<br>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain, but though we had already suffered and been shamefully maltreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition. For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts. As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed; nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children. So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.</p>
<p>You remember our labour and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was towards you believers. As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children, urging and encouraging you and pleading that you should lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</p>

<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, ‘Rabbi, eat something.’ But he said to them, ‘I have food to eat that you do not know about.’ So the disciples said to one another, ‘Surely no one has brought him something to eat?’ Jesus said to them, ‘My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. Do you not say, “Four months more, then comes the harvest”? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</p>

<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>

Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart.
