<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from second Kings.</p>
<p>When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”</p>
<p>Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho. The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the Lord will take your master away from you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; be silent.”</p>
<p>Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.</p>
<p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.” He responded, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.” As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, “Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</p>

<p>1 The Lord, the God of gods, has spoken; *<br>
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.<br>
<strong>2 Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, *<br>
God reveals himself in glory.</strong></p>
<p>3 Our God will come and will not keep silence; *<br>
before him there is a consuming flame,<br>
and round about him a raging storm.<br>

to witness the judgment of his people.</strong></p>
<p>5 &ldquo;Gather before me my loyal followers, *<br>
those who have made a covenant with me<br>
and sealed it with sacrifice.&rdquo;<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake. For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no one on earth could bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus. Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what to say, for they were terrified. Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a voice, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!” Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.</p>
<p>As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>

<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

<p><em>It Is Well with My Soul</em> (LEVAS 188)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,<br>
When sorrows like seabillows roll;<br>
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,<br>
It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Refrain:<br>
It is well with my soul,<br>
It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
Though satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br>
Let this blest assurance control,<br>
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,<br>
And has shed His own blood for my soul. [Refrain]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought<br>
My sin not in part, but the whole<br>
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! [Refrain]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
And, Lord, hast the day when the faith shall be sight,<br>
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,<br>
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,<br>
“Even so” it is well with my soul. [Refrain]</p>
