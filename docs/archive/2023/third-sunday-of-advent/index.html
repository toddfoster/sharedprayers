<p>Today we light the first, second, and third candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, and the third candle is JOY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. (Isaiah 55:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gracious God, you came to us in human flesh and you abide with us in the Holy Spirit. Fill us with your joy, and help us shine as a light to the world. Through Jesus Christ, who makes our joy complete. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom;<br>
like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing.<br>
The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.<br>
They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.<br>
Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.<br>
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, &ldquo;Be strong, do not fear!<br>
Here is your God. He will come with vengeance,<br>
with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.&rdquo;<br>
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;<br>
then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy.<br>
For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;<br>
the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water;<br>
the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes.<br>
A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way;<br>
the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God&rsquo;s people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.<br>
No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it;<br>
they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.<br>
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing;<br>
everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>

<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>

From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>

<p>Be patient, therefore, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains. You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that you may not be judged. See, the Judge is standing at the doors! As an example of suffering and patience, beloved, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?” Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them. And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”</p>
<p>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’</p>
