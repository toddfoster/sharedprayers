<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”</p>

<p><em>Benedic, anima mea</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *<br>
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.<br>
<strong>2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *<br>
and forget not all his benefits.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He forgives all your sins *<br>
and heals all your infirmities;<br>
<strong>4	He redeems your life from the grave *<br>
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He satisfies you with good things, *<br>
and your youth is renewed like an eagle&rsquo;s.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD executes righteousness *<br>
and judgment for all who are oppressed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	He made his ways known to Moses *<br>
and his works to the children of Israel.<br>
<strong>8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *<br>
slow to anger and of great kindness.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	He will not always accuse us, *<br>
nor will he keep his anger for ever.<br>
<strong>10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *<br>
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *<br>
so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.<br>
<strong>12	As far as the east is from the west, *<br>
so far has he removed our sins from us.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	As a father cares for his children, *<br>
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.<br>
<strong>14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *<br>
he remembers that we are but dust.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Our days are like the grass; *<br>
we flourish like a flower of the field;<br>
<strong>16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *<br>
and its place shall know it no more.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever<br>
on those who fear him, *<br>
and his righteousness on children&rsquo;s children;<br>
<strong>18	On those who keep his covenant *<br>
and remember his commandments and do them.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *<br>
and his kingship has dominion over all.<br>
<strong>20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,<br>
you mighty ones who do his bidding, *<br>
and hearken to the voice of his word.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *<br>
you ministers of his who do his will.<br>
<strong>22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,<br>
in all places of his dominion; *<br>
bless the LORD, O my soul.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>War broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</p>
<p>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah,<br>
for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.<br>
But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,<br>
for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.<br>
Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them!<br>
But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you<br>
with great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!”</p></blockquote>

<p>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</p>

he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>

And now, Father, send us out<br>
to do the work you have given us to do,<br>

as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
