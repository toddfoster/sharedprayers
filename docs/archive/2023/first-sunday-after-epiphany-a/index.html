<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Here is my servant, whom I uphold,<br>
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;<br>
I have put my spirit upon him;<br>
he will bring forth justice to the nations.<br>
He will not cry or lift up his voice,<br>
or make it heard in the street;<br>
a bruised reed he will not break,<br>
and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;<br>
he will faithfully bring forth justice.<br>
He will not grow faint or be crushed<br>
until he has established justice in the earth;<br>
and the coastlands wait for his teaching.</p>
<p>Thus says God, the Lord,<br>
who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br>
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,<br>
who gives breath to the people upon it<br>
and spirit to those who walk in it:<br>
I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,<br>
I have taken you by the hand and kept you;<br>
I have given you as a covenant to the people,<br>
a light to the nations,<br>
to open the eyes that are blind,<br>
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,<br>
from the prison those who sit in darkness.<br>
I am the Lord, that is my name;<br>
my glory I give to no other,<br>
nor my praise to idols.<br>
See, the former things have come to pass,<br>
and new things I now declare;<br>
before they spring forth,<br>
I tell you of them.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
