<p>The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the LORD replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command.</p>

&ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *<br>

<blockquote>

his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *<br>
nor of the arrow that flies by day;<br>

nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7	A thousand shall fall at your side<br>
and ten thousand at your right hand, *<br>
but it shall not come near you.<br>
<strong>8	Your eyes have only to behold *<br>
to see the reward of the wicked.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *<br>
and the Most High your habitation,<br>
<strong>10	There shall no evil happen to you, *<br>
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, *<br>
to keep you in all your ways.<br>

lest you dash your foot against a stone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *<br>
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.<br>
<strong>14	Because he is bound to me in love,<br>
therefore will I deliver him; *<br>
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.</strong></p>

I am with him in trouble;<br>
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.</p>
<p>I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</p>

<p>A dispute arose among the disciples as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</p>
<p>“You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
