<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br>
Announce to my people their rebellion, to the house of Jacob their sins.<br>
Yet day after day they seek me and delight to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;<br>
they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.<br>
“Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”<br>
Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers.<br>
Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist.<br>
Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.<br>
Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself?<br>
Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?<br>
Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?<br>
Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br>
to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?<br>
Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br>
when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?<br>
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br>
your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.<br>
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.<br>
[If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,<br>
if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,<br>
then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.<br>
The LORD will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong;<br>
and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail.<br>
Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br>
you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in.]</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-21-1213-16_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 2:1-12,(13-16)</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.</p>
<p>Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish. But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived,<br>
what God has prepared for those who love him”—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God. [And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.</p>
<p>Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we have the mind of Christ.]</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.</p>
<p>“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</p>
<p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<p><strong>Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,<br>
heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br>

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>
We proclaim his resurrection,<br>
We await his coming in glory;</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-2">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
