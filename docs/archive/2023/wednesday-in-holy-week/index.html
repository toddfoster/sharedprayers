<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God has given me<br>
the tongue of a teacher,<br>
that I may know how to sustain<br>
the weary with a word.<br>
Morning by morning he wakens—<br>
wakens my ear<br>
to listen as those who are taught.<br>
The Lord God has opened my ear,<br>
and I was not rebellious,<br>
I did not turn backwards.<br>
I gave my back to those who struck me,<br>
and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;<br>
I did not hide my face<br>
from insult and spitting.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God helps me;<br>
therefore I have not been disgraced;<br>
therefore I have set my face like flint,<br>
and I know that I shall not be put to shame;<br>
he who vindicates me is near.<br>
Who will contend with me?<br>
Let us stand up together.<br>
Who are my adversaries?<br>
Let them confront me.<br>
It is the Lord God who helps me;<br>
who will declare me guilty?<br>
All of them will wear out like a garment;<br>
the moth will eat them up.</p></blockquote>

<p>1	Be pleased, O God, to deliver me; *<br>
O LORD, make haste to help me.<br>
<strong>2	Let those who seek my life be ashamed<br>
and altogether dismayed; *<br>
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune<br>
draw back and be disgraced.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Let those who say to me &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; and gloat over me turn back, *<br>
because they are ashamed.<br>
<strong>4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; *<br>
let those who love your salvation say for ever,<br>
&ldquo;Great is the LORD!&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	But as for me, I am poor and needy; *<br>
come to me speedily, O God.<br>
<strong>6	You are my helper and my deliverer; *<br>
O LORD, do not tarry.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
<p>Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.</p>

<p>At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>
<p>When he had gone out, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

still seeking not himself, but us.</p>
