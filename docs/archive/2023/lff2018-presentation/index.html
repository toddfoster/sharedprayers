<p>A reading from the prophet Malachi.</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord, See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight&ndash; indeed, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?</p>
<p>For he is like a refiner&rsquo;s fire and like fullers&rsquo; soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the LORD in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *<br>
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;<br>
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.<br>
<strong>2	The sparrow has found her a house<br>
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *<br>
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,<br>
my King and my God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *<br>
they will always be praising you.<br>
<strong>4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *<br>
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&rsquo; way.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *<br>
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.<br>
<strong>6	They will climb from height to height, *<br>
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *<br>
hearken, O God of Jacob.<br>
<strong>8	Behold our defender, O God; *<br>
and look upon the face of your Anointed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	For one day in your courts is better than<br>
a thousand in my own room, *<br>
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God<br>
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br>
<strong>10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *<br>
he will give grace and glory;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *<br>
from those who walk with integrity.<br>

happy are they who put their trust in you!</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-hebrews-214-18">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 2:14-18</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>

<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.</p>
<h5 id="people-6"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;<br>
for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And the child&rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food<br>
of the most precious Body and Blood<br>
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;<br>
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries<br>
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,<br>
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.<br>
And now, Father, send us out<br>
to do the work you have given us to do,<br>
to love and serve you<br>
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
