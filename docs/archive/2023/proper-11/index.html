<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”</p>
<p>So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel.</p>

<p><em>Domine, probasti</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *<br>
you know my sitting down and my rising up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.<br>
<strong>2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *<br>
and are acquainted with all my ways.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *<br>
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.<br>
<strong>4 You press upon me behind and before *<br>
and lay your hand upon me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *<br>
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.<br>
<strong>6 Where can I go then from your Spirit? *<br>
where can I flee from your presence?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *<br>
if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.<br>
<strong>8 If I take the wings of the morning *<br>
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Even there your hand will lead me *<br>
and your right hand hold me fast.<br>
<strong>10 If I say, &ldquo;Surely the darkness will cover me, *<br>
and the light around me turn to night,&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 Darkness is not dark to you;<br>
the night is as bright as the day; *<br>
darkness and light to you are both alike.<br>
<strong>22 Search me out, O God, and know my heart; *<br>
try me and know my restless thoughts.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 Look well whether there be any wickedness in me *<br>
and lead me in the way that is everlasting.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_romans-812-25_">The Second Lesson: <em>Romans 8:12-25</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh&ndash; for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, “Abba! Father!” it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
<p>I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p>

<p>Jesus put before the crowd another parable: “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field; but while everybody was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared as well. And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where, then, did these weeds come from?’ He answered, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he replied, ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them. Let both of them grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’”</p>
<p>Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom; the weeds are the children of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
