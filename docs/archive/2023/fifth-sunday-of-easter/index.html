<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Filled with the Holy Spirit, Stephen gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. “Look,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
<p>Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation— if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.</p>
<p>Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in scripture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious;<br>
and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The stone that the builders rejected has become the very head of the corner”,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A stone that makes them stumble, and a rock that makes them fall.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</p>
<p>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people;<br>
once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</p>

In Christ there is no East or West,<br>
in him no South or North,<br>
but one great fellowship of love<br>
throughout the whole wide earth.</p>

Join hands, disciples of the faith,<br>
whate&rsquo;er your race may be!<br>
Who serves my Father as his child<br>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said, “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. And you know the way to the place where I am going.” Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”</p>
<p>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.” Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food<br>
of the most precious Body and Blood<br>
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;<br>
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries<br>
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,<br>
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.<br>
And now, Father, send us out<br>
to do the work you have given us to do,<br>
to love and serve you<br>
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
I come with joy to meet my Lord,<br>
forgiven, loved, and free,<br>
in awe and wonder to recall,<br>
his life laid down for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I come with Christians far and near<br>
to find, as all are fed,<br>
the new community of love<br>
in Christ&rsquo;s communion bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,<br>
each proud division ends.<br>
The love that made us, makes us one,<br>
and strangers now are friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.<br>
His presence, always near,<br>
is in such friendship better known,<br>
we see and praise him here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5<br>
Together met, together bound,<br>
we&rsquo;ll go our different ways<br>
and as his people in the world,<br>
we&rsquo;ll live and speak his praise.</p>
