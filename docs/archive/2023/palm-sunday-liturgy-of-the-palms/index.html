Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, &lsquo;Why are you untying it?&rsquo; just say this, &lsquo;The Lord needs it.&rsquo;&rdquo; So those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, &ldquo;Why are you untying the colt?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;The Lord needs it.&rdquo; Then they brought it to Jesus; and after throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. As he rode along, people kept spreading their cloaks on the road.
