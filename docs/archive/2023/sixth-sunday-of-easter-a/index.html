<h3 id="the-first-lesson-acts-1722-31">The First Lesson: <em>Acts 17:22-31</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things. From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘For we too are his offspring.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals. While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”</p>

<h3 id="psalm-667-18">Psalm 66:7-18</h3>
<p><em>Jubilate Deo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 Bless our God, you peoples; *<br>
make the voice of his praise to be heard;<br>
<strong>8 Who holds our souls in life, *<br>
and will not allow our feet to slip.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 For you, O God, have proved us; *<br>
you have tried us just as silver is tried.<br>
<strong>10 You brought us into the snare; *<br>
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 You let enemies ride over our heads;<br>
we went through fire and water; *<br>
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.<br>
<strong>12 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings<br>
and will pay you my vows, *<br>
which I promised with my lips<br>
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts<br>
with the smoke of rams; *<br>
I will give you oxen and goats.<br>
<strong>14 Come and listen, all you who fear God, *<br>
and I will tell you what he has done for me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 I called out to him with my mouth, *<br>
and his praise was on my tongue.<br>
<strong>16 If I had found evil in my heart, *<br>
the Lord would not have heard me;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17 But in truth God has heard me; *<br>
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.<br>
<strong>18 Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *<br>
nor withheld his love from me.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus said, ”If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.</p>
<p>”I will not leave you orphaned; I am coming to you. In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. They who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
