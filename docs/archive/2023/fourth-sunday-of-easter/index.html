<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Those who had been baptized devoted themselves to the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.</p>
<p>Awe came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles. All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Peter’s first epistle.</p>
<p>It is a credit to you if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly. If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong, what credit is that? But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God&rsquo;s approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When he was abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. For you were going astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
God is Love: let heaven adore him;<br>
God is Love: let earth rejoice;<br>
let creation sing before him,<br>
and exalt him with one voice.<br>
God who laid the earth&rsquo;s foundation,<br>
God who spread the heavens above,<br>
God who breathes through all creation,<br>
God is Love, eternal Love.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
God is Love: and love enfolds us,<br>
all the world in one embrace;<br>
with unfailing grasp God holds us<br>
every child of every race.<br>
And when human hearts are breaking<br>
under sorrow&rsquo;s iron rod,<br>
then they find that selfsame aching<br>
deep within the heart of God.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
God is Love: and though with blindness<br>
sin afflicts all human life,<br>
God&rsquo;s eternal loving-kindness<br>
guides us through our earthly strife.<br>
Sin and death and hell shall never<br>
o&rsquo;er us final triumph gain;<br>
God is Love, so Love for ever<br>
o&rsquo;er the universe must reign.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.</p>
<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said, “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.” Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
<p>So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>

he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

Savior, like a shepherd lead us;<br>

Blessèd Jesus! Blessèd Jesus!<br>
Thou hast bought us, thine we are.</p></blockquote>

Early let us seek thy favor,<br>
early let us learn thy will;<br>
do thou, Lord, our only Savior,<br>
with thy love our bosoms fill.<br>
Blessèd Jesus! Blessèd Jesus!<br>
Thou hast loved us: love us still.</p></blockquote>
