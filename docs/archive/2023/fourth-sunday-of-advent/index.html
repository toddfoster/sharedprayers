<p>Today we light the first, second, third, and fourth candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to them, I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loving God, your mercy and compassion endure forever. Open our hearts, that we may receive your love; and following the example of your Son, spread that love to a love-starved world. Through Jesus Christ, who loved us to the end. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel. He shall eat curds and honey by the time he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.”</p>

<strong>4	O LORD God of hosts, *<br>
how long will you be angered despite the prayers of your people?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You have fed them with the bread of tears; *<br>
you have given them bowls of tears to drink.<br>
<strong>6	You have made us the derision of our neighbors, *<br>
and our enemies laugh us to scorn.</strong></p>

<p>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name, including yourselves who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means, “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
