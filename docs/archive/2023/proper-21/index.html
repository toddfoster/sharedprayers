<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” So Moses cried out to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” The LORD said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 That which we have heard and known,<br>
and what our forefathers have told us, *<br>
we will not hide from their children.<br>
<strong>4 We will recount to generations to come<br>
the praiseworthy deeds and the power of the LORD, *<br>
and the wonderful works he has done.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>12 He worked marvels in the sight of their forefathers, *<br>
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br>
<strong>13 He split open the sea and let them pass through; *<br>
he made the waters stand up like walls.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>14 He led them with a cloud by day, *<br>
and all the night through with a glow of fire.<br>
<strong>15 He split the hard rocks in the wilderness *<br>
and gave them drink as from the great deep.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_philippians-21-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>Philippians 2:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy, make my joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,<br>
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.<br>
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death&ndash; even death on a cross.<br>
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,<br>
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Glorious things of thee are spoken,<br>
Zion, city of our God;<br>
he whose word cannot be broken<br>
formed thee for his own abode;<br>
on the Rock of Ages founded,<br>
what can shake thy sure repose?<br>
With salvation&rsquo;s walls surrounded,<br>
thou may&rsquo;st smile at all thy foes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
See! the streams of living waters,<br>
springing from eternal love,<br>
well supply thy sons and daughters<br>
and all fear of want remove.<br>
Who can faint, when such a river<br>
ever flows their thirst to assuage?<br>
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,<br>
never fails from age to age.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Round each habitation hovering,<br>
see the cloud and fire appear<br>
for a glory and a covering,<br>
showing that the Lord is near.<br>
Thus deriving from their banner,<br>
light by night, and shade by day;<br>
safe they feed upon the manna<br>
which he gives them when they pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
Blest inhabitants of Zion,<br>
washed in the Redeemer&rsquo;s blood!<br>
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,<br>
makes them kings and priests to God.<br>
&lsquo;Tis his love his people raises<br>
over self to reign as kings:<br>
and as priests, his solemn praises<br>
each for a thank-offering brings.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>When Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we are afraid of the crowd; for all regard John as a prophet.” So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</p>
<p>“What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ He answered, ‘I will not’; but later he changed his mind and went. The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir’; but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
