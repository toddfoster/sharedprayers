<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom<br>
and thanksgiving and honor<br>
and power and might<br>
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.<br>
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;<br>
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,<br>
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John.</p>
<p>See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p>

<p>When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo;</p>

Over it the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation.<br>
Through it you led the children of Israel out of their bondage<br>

received the baptism of John and was anointed by the Holy<br>
Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death<br>
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.<br>
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are<br>
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his<br>
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.<br>
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his<br>
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in<br>
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

Spirit you have bestowed upon these your servants the<br>
forgiveness of sin, and have raised them to the new life of<br>
grace. Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit. Give them<br>
an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to<br>
persevere, a spirit to know and to love you, and the gift of joy<br>
and wonder in all your works.</p>

<p><strong>Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,<br>

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-2"><strong>Celebrant and People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>We praise you, we bless you,<br>
we give thanks to you,<br>
and we pray to you, Lord our God.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-2">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, Sally our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.</p>
<p>Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.</p>
<p>Remember <em>N. and</em> all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.</p>
<p>Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.</p>
<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.</p>
