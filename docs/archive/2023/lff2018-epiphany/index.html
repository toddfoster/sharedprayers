<blockquote>
<p>Arise, shine; for your light has come,<br>
and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.<br>
For darkness shall cover the earth,<br>
and thick darkness the peoples;<br>
but the Lord will arise upon you,<br>
and his glory will appear over you.<br>
Nations shall come to your light,<br>
and kings to the brightness of your dawn.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lift up your eyes and look around;<br>
they all gather together, they come to you;<br>
your sons shall come from far away,<br>
and your daughters shall be carried on their nurses’ arms.<br>
Then you shall see and be radiant;<br>
your heart shall thrill and rejoice,<br>
because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you,<br>
the wealth of the nations shall come to you.<br>
A multitude of camels shall cover you,<br>
the young camels of Midian and Ephah;<br>
all those from Sheba shall come.<br>
They shall bring gold and frankincense,<br>
and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.<br>
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you,<br>
the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you;<br>
they shall be acceptable on my altar,<br>
and I will glorify my glorious house.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who are these that fly like a cloud,<br>
and like doves to their windows?<br>
For the coastlands shall wait for me,<br>
the ships of Tarshish first,<br>
to bring your children from far away,<br>
their silver and gold with them,<br>
for the name of the Lord your God,<br>
and for the Holy One of Israel,<br>
because he has glorified you.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>1	Give the King your justice, O God, *<br>
and your righteousness to the King&rsquo;s son;<br>
<strong>2	That he may rule your people righteously *<br>
and the poor with justice.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *<br>

<strong>4	He shall defend the needy among the people; *<br>
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, *<br>
from one generation to another.<br>
<strong>6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, *<br>
like showers that water the earth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	In his time shall the righteous flourish; *<br>
there shall be abundance of peace till the moon shall be no more.<br>
<strong>8	He shall rule from sea to sea, *<br>

<blockquote>
<p>9	His foes shall bow down before him, *<br>
and his enemies lick the dust.<br>
<strong>10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute, *<br>
and the kings of Arabia and Saba offer gifts.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	All kings shall bow down before him, *<br>
and all the nations do him service.<br>
<strong>12	For he shall deliver the poor who cries out in distress, *<br>
and the oppressed who has no helper.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	He shall have pity on the lowly and poor; *<br>
he shall preserve the lives of the needy.<br>
<strong>14	He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, *<br>
and dear shall their blood be in his sight.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Long may he live!<br>
and may there be given to him gold from Arabia; *<br>
may prayer be made for him always,<br>
and may they bless him all the day long.<br>
<strong>16	May there be abundance of grain on the earth,<br>
growing thick even on the hilltops; *<br>
may its fruit flourish like Lebanon,<br>
and its grain like grass upon the earth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	May his Name remain for ever<br>
and be established as long as the sun endures; *<br>
may all the nations bless themselves in him and<br>
call him blessed.<br>
<strong>18	Blessed be the Lord GOD, the God of Israel, *<br>
who alone does wondrous deeds!</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	And blessed be his glorious Name for ever! *<br>

Amen. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&ndash; for surely you have already heard of the commission of God&rsquo;s grace that was given me for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>
<p>Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God&rsquo;s grace that was given me by the working of his power. Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, &ldquo;Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.&rdquo; When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>
for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &ldquo;Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.&rdquo; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
