<p>Today we light the first and second candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. (Colossians 3:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.<br>
The spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.<br>
His delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.<br>
He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear;<br>
but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;<br>
he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.<br>
Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins.<br>
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid,<br>
the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.<br>
The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.<br>
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder&rsquo;s den.<br>
They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain;<br>
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.</p>

<strong>2 That he may rule your people righteously *<br>
and the poor with justice;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *<br>
and the little hills bring righteousness.<br>
<strong>4 He shall defend the needy among the people; *<br>
he shall rescue the poor and crush the oppressor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 He shall live as long as the sun and moon endure, *<br>
from one generation to another.<br>
<strong>6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown field, *<br>
like showers that water the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 In his time shall the righteous flourish; *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_romans-154-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>Romans 15:4-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope. May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and again he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and again,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and again Isaiah says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p>But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>
<p>“I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”</p>

<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,</p>

world in his name.</p>
