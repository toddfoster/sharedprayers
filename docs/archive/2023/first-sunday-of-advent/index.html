<blockquote>
<p>In days to come the mountain of the LORD’s house<br>
shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills;<br>
all the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say,<br>
‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;<br>
that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.’<br>
For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.<br>
He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples;<br>
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;<br>
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.<br>
O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>You know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p>

<p>Jesus said to the disciples, “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”</p>

<p>Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this sacrifice of thanksgiving,</p>
