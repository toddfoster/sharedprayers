<p>A reading from the prophet Micah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear what the LORD says: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.<br>
Hear, you mountains, the controversy of the LORD, and you enduring foundations of the earth;<br>
for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.<br>
“O my people, what have I done to you? In what have I wearied you? Answer me!<br>
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of slavery;<br>
and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.<br>
O my people, remember now what King Balak of Moab devised, what Balaam son of Beor answered him,<br>
and what happened from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the saving acts of the LORD.”<br>
“With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high?<br>
Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?<br>
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of rivers of oil?<br>
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”<br>
He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you<br>
but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.</p>
<p>Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. &ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they 		 persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
