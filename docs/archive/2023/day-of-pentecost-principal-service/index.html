<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_acts-21-21_">The First Lesson: <em>Acts 2:1-21</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.</p>
<p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&rsquo;s deeds of power.&rdquo; All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; But others sneered and said, &ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, &ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;In the last days it will be, God declares,<br>
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,<br>
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.<br>
Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.<br>
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.<br>
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord&rsquo;s great and glorious day.<br>
Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo; &quot;</p>

<p><em>Benedic, anima mea</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>25	O LORD, how manifold are your <strong>works!</strong> *<br>
in wisdom you have made them all;<br>
the earth is full of your <strong>creatures.</strong><br>
26	Yonder is the great and wide sea<br>
with its living things too many to <strong>number,</strong> *<br>
creatures both small and <strong>great.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>27	There move the ships,<br>
and there is that Lev - <strong>iathan,</strong> *<br>
which you have made for the <strong>sport of it.</strong><br>
28	All of them look to **you ***<br>
to give them their food in due <strong>season.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>29	You give it to them; they <strong>gather it;</strong> *<br>
you open your hand, and they are filled with good <strong>things.</strong><br>
30	You hide your face, and they are <strong>terrified;</strong> *<br>
you take away their breath,<br>
and they die and return to their <strong>dust.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>31	You send forth your Spirit, and they are cre - <strong>ated;</strong> *<br>
and so you renew the face of the <strong>earth.</strong><br>
32	May the glory of the LORD endure for <strong>ever;</strong> *<br>
may the LORD rejoice in all his <strong>works.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>33	He looks at the earth and it <strong>trembles;</strong> *<br>
he touches the mountains and they <strong>smoke.</strong><br>
34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I <strong>live;</strong> *<br>
I will praise my God while I have my <strong>being.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>35	May these words of mine <strong>please him;</strong> *<br>
I will rejoice in the <strong>LORD.</strong><br>
37	Bless the LORD, O my <strong>soul.</strong> *<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>No one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.</p>
<p>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&ndash; Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&ndash; and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Come down, O Love divine,<br>
seek thou this soul of mine,<br>
and visit it with thine own ardor glowing;<br>
O Comforter, draw near,<br>
within my heart appear,<br>
and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
O let it freely burn,<br>
till earthly passions turn<br>
to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;<br>
and let thy glorious light<br>
shine ever on my sight,<br>
and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
And so the yearning strong,<br>
with which the soul will long,<br>
shall far outpass the power of human telling;<br>
for none can guess its grace,<br>
till Love create a place<br>
wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.</p>

<p>When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,<br>
with all thy quickening powers;<br>
kindle a flame of sacred love<br>
in these cold hearts of ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
See how we trifle here below,<br>
fond of these earthly toys:<br>
our souls, how heavily they go,<br>
to reach eternal joys.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
In vain we tune our formal songs,<br>
in vain we strive to rise:<br>
hosannas languish on our tongues,<br>
and our devotion dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,<br>
with all thy quickening powers;<br>
come, shed abroad a Savior&rsquo;s love,<br>
and that shall kindle ours.</p>

<p>1<br>
We walk by faith, and not by sight;<br>
no gracious words we hear from him<br>
who spoke as none e&rsquo;er spoke;<br>
but we believe him near.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
We may not touch his hands and side,<br>
nor follow where he trod;<br>
but in his promise we rejoice;<br>
and cry, &ldquo;My Lord and God!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;<br>
and may our faith abound,<br>
to call on you when you are near,<br>
and seek where you are found:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
that, when our life of faith is done,<br>
in realms of clearer light<br>
we may behold you as you are,<br>
with full and endless sight.</p>
