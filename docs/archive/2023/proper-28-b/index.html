<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.</p>

sing the glory of his Name;<br>
sing the glory of his praise.<br>
<strong>2	Say to God, &ldquo;How awesome are your deeds! *<br>
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	All the earth bows down before you, *<br>
sings to you, sings out your Name.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	Come now and see the works of God, *<br>
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He turned the sea into dry land,<br>
so that they went through the water on foot, *<br>
and there we rejoiced in him.<br>
<strong>6	In his might he rules for ever;<br>
his eyes keep watch over the nations; *<br>
let no rebel rise up against him.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Bless our God, you peoples; *<br>
make the voice of his praise to be heard;<br>
<strong>8	Who holds our souls in life, *<br>
and will not allow our feet to slip.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	For you, O God, have proved us; *<br>
you have tried us just as silver is tried.<br>
<strong>10	You brought us into the snare; *<br>
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	You let enemies ride over our heads;<br>
we went through fire and water; *<br>
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.<br>
<strong>12	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings<br>
and will pay you my vows, *<br>
which I promised with my lips<br>
and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts<br>
with the smoke of rams; *<br>
I will give you oxen and goats.<br>
<strong>14	Come and listen, all you who fear God, *<br>
and I will tell you what he has done for me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	I called out to him with my mouth, *<br>
and his praise was on my tongue.<br>
<strong>16	If I had found evil in my heart, *<br>
the Lord would not have heard me;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	But in truth God has heard me; *<br>
he has attended to the voice of my prayer.<br>
<strong>18	Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer, *<br>
nor withheld his love from me.</strong></p>

let all the peoples praise you.<br>

<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_1-maccabees-229-4349-50_">The First Lesson: <em>1 Maccabees 2.29-43,49-50</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from first Maccabees.</p>
<p>At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there, they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them. And it was reported to the king’s officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that those who had rejected the king’s command had gone down to the hiding-places in the wilderness. Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day. They said to them, ‘Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live.’ But they said, ‘We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day.’ Then the enemy quickly attacked them. But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding-places, for they said, ‘Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly.’ So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and livestock, to the number of a thousand people.</p>
<p>When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply. And all said to their neighbours: ‘If we all do as our kindred have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth.’ So they made this decision that day: ‘Let us fight against anyone who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our kindred died in their hiding-places.’</p>
<p>Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, all who offered themselves willingly for the law. And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.</p>
<p>Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: ‘Arrogance and scorn have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger. Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our ancestors.</p>

<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>There we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. The believers from there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.</p>
<p>When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.</p>
<p>Three days later he called together the local leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them, ‘Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, yet I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. When they had examined me, the Romans wanted to release me, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to the emperor—even though I had no charge to bring against my nation. For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.’ They replied, ‘We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you. But we would like to hear from you what you think, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.’</p>
<p>After they had fixed a day to meet him, they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers. From morning until evening he explained the matter to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.</p>
