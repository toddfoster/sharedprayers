<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle of James.</p>
<p>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies. Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.</p>
<p>How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell. For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue&ndash; a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water? Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.</p>

<p><em>Caeli enarrant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 The law of the LORD is perfect<br>
and revives the soul; *<br>
the testimony of the LORD is sure<br>
and gives wisdom to the innocent.<br>
<strong>8 The statutes of the LORD are just<br>
and rejoice the heart; *<br>
the commandment of the LORD is clear<br>
and gives light to the eyes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 The fear of the LORD is clean<br>
and endures for ever; *<br>
the judgments of the LORD are true<br>
and righteous altogether.<br>
<strong>10 More to be desired are they than gold,<br>
more than much fine gold, *<br>
sweeter far than honey,<br>
than honey in the comb.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 By them also is your servant enlightened, *<br>
and in keeping them there is great reward.<br>
<strong>12 Who can tell how often he offends? *<br>
cleanse me from my secret faults.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;<br>
let them not get dominion over me; *<br>
then shall I be whole and sound,<br>
and innocent of a great offense.<br>
<strong>14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my<br>
heart be acceptable in your sight, *<br>
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores. The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.&rsquo; But Abraham said, &lsquo;Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father&rsquo;s house&ndash; for I have five brothers&ndash; that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.&rsquo; Abraham replied, &lsquo;They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
