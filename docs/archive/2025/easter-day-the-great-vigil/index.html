<p>Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our<br>
Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites<br>
her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in<br>
vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which,<br>
by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share<br>
in his victory over death.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us pray.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, through your Son you have bestowed upon your<br>
people the brightness of your light: Sanctify this new fire, and<br>
grant that in this Paschal feast we may so burn with heavenly<br>
desires, that with pure minds we may attain to the festival of<br>
everlasting light; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong></p></blockquote>

at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,<br>
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children<br>
of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the<br>
Red Sea on dry land.</p></blockquote>

mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you<br>
gave a Son.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How holy is this night, when wickedness is put to flight, and<br>
sin is washed away. It restores innocence to the fallen, and joy<br>
to those who mourn. It casts out pride and hatred, and brings<br>
peace and concord.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined<br>
and man is reconciled to God.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice, the offering of this<br>
candle in your honor. May it shine continually to drive away<br>
all darkness. May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no<br>
setting, find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all<br>
creation, and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <strong>Amen.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>On the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in, they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &ldquo;Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.&rdquo; Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.</p>

<p>Through the Paschal mystery, dear friends, we are buried with Christ by Baptism into his death, and raised with him to newness of life.

<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1"><strong>Celebrant and People:</strong></h5>

<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>Remember Sean, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.</p>
<p>Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.</p>
<p>Remember [<em>N. and</em>] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.</p>
<p>Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.</p>
<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.</p>
