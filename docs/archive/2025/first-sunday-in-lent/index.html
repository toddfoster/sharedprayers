<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, &ldquo;No one who believes in him will be put to shame.&rdquo; For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, &ldquo;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>After his baptism, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished. The devil said to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;One does not live by bread alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, &ldquo;To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is said, &lsquo;Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&rsquo;&rdquo; When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
<h5 id="presider-5">Presider:</h5>
