<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.” But the word of the LORD came to him, “This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.” He brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.</p>
<p>Then he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?” He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</p>
<p>As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.</p>
<p>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.”</p>

<p><em>Dominus illuminatio</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	The LORD is my light and my salvation;<br>
whom then shall I fear? *<br>
the LORD is the strength of my life;<br>
of whom then shall I be afraid?<br>
<strong>2	When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, *<br>
it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Though an army should encamp against me, *<br>
yet my heart shall not be afraid;<br>
<strong>4	And though war should rise up against me, *<br>
yet will I put my trust in him.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;<br>
one thing I seek; *<br>
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days<br>
of my life;<br>
<strong>6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *<br>
and to seek him in his temple.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; *<br>
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling<br>
and set me high upon a rock.<br>
<strong>8	Even now he lifts up my head *<br>
above my enemies round about me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation<br>
with sounds of great gladness; *<br>
I will sing and make music to the LORD.<br>
<strong>10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *<br>
have mercy on me and answer me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	You speak in my heart and say, &ldquo;Seek my face.&rdquo; *<br>
Your face, LORD, will I seek.<br>
<strong>12	Hide not your face from me, *<br>
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	You have been my helper;<br>
cast me not away; *<br>
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.<br>
<strong>14	Though my father and my mother forsake me, *<br>
the LORD will sustain me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Show me your way, O LORD; *<br>
lead me on a level path, because of my enemies.<br>
<strong>16	Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, *<br>
for false witnesses have risen up against me,<br>
and also those who speak malice.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	What if I had not believed<br>
that I should see the goodness of the LORD *<br>
in the land of the living!<br>
<strong>18	O tarry and await the LORD&rsquo;S pleasure;<br>
be strong, and he shall comfort your heart; *<br>
wait patiently for the LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.</p>

Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.&rsquo; Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you.

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I bind this day to me for ever,<br>
by power of faith, Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation;<br>
his baptism in the Jordan river;<br>
his death on cross for my salvation;<br>
his bursting from the spiced tomb;<br>
his riding up the heavenly way;<br>
his coming at the day of doom:<br>
I bind unto myself today.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
I bind unto myself the power<br>
of the great love of cherubim;<br>
the sweet &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; in judgment hour;<br>
the service of the seraphim;<br>
confessors&rsquo; faith, apostles&rsquo; word,<br>
the patriarchs&rsquo; prayers, the prophets&rsquo; scrolls;<br>
all good deeds done unto the Lord,<br>
and purity of virgin souls.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the virtues of the star-lit heaven<br>
the glorious sun&rsquo;s life-giving ray,<br>
the whiteness of the moon at even,<br>
the flashing of the lightning free,<br>
the whirling wind&rsquo;s tempestuous shocks,<br>
the stable earth, the deep salt sea,<br>
around the old eternal rocks.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the power of God to hold and lead,<br>
his eye to watch, his might to stay,<br>
his ear to hearken, to my need;<br>
the wisdom of my God to teach,<br>
his hand to guide, his shield to ward;<br>
the word of God to give me speech,<br>
his heavenly host to be my guard.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6<br>
Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br>
Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br>
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br>
Christ to comfort and restore me,<br>
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br>
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br>
Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br>
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7<br>
I bind unto myself the Name,<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.<br>
Of whom all nature hath creation,<br>
eternal Father, Spirit, Word:<br>
praise to the Lord of my salvation,<br>
salvation is of Christ the Lord.</p></blockquote>
