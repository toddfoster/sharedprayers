<p>When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.</p>

<p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
