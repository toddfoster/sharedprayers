<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;<br>
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.<br>
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;<br>
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.<br>
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;<br>
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.<br>
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;<br>
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.<br>
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br>
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;<br>
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br>
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;<br>
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&ndash; and their descendants as well.<br>
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.<br>
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&ndash; its food shall be dust!<br>
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paulâ€™s second epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, and we did not eat anyone&rsquo;s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you. This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.</p>

<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-215-19">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 21:5-19</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Lukeâ€™s Gospel.</p>
<p>When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked him, &ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, &lsquo;I am he!&rsquo; and, &lsquo;The time is near!&rsquo; Do not go after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe in God, <strong>the Father almighty,<br>
creator of heaven and earth.<br>
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
He descended to the dead.<br>
On the third day he rose again.<br>
He ascended into heaven,<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
