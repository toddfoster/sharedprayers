<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,<br>
who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior;<br>
they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:<br>
Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.<br>
I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?<br>
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.<br>
The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches;<br>
for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert,<br>
to give drink to my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself<br>
so that they might declare my praise.</p>

then were we like those who dream.<br>
<strong>2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *<br>
and our tongue with shouts of joy.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3	Then they said among the nations, *<br>
&ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	The LORD has done great things for us, *<br>
and we are glad indeed.</strong></p>

will reap with songs of joy.</strong></p>

will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_philippians-34b-14_">The Second Lesson: <em>Philippians 3:4b-14</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</p>
<p>Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I bind this day to me for ever,<br>
by power of faith, Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation;<br>
his baptism in the Jordan river;<br>
his death on cross for my salvation;<br>
his bursting from the spiced tomb;<br>
his riding up the heavenly way;<br>
his coming at the day of doom:<br>
I bind unto myself today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
I bind unto myself the power<br>
of the great love of cherubim;<br>
the sweet &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; in judgment hour;<br>
the service of the seraphim;<br>
confessors&rsquo; faith, apostles&rsquo; word,<br>
the patriarchs&rsquo; prayers, the prophets&rsquo; scrolls;<br>
all good deeds done unto the Lord,<br>
and purity of virgin souls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the virtues of the star-lit heaven<br>
the glorious sun&rsquo;s life-giving ray,<br>
the whiteness of the moon at even,<br>
the flashing of the lightning free,<br>
the whirling wind&rsquo;s tempestuous shocks,<br>
the stable earth, the deep salt sea,<br>
around the old eternal rocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the power of God to hold and lead,<br>
his eye to watch, his might to stay,<br>
his ear to hearken, to my need;<br>
the wisdom of my God to teach,<br>
his hand to guide, his shield to ward;<br>
the word of God to give me speech,<br>
his heavenly host to be my guard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6<br>
Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br>
Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br>
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br>
Christ to comfort and restore me,<br>
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br>
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br>
Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br>
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7<br>
I bind unto myself the Name,<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.<br>
Of whom all nature hath creation,<br>
eternal Father, Spirit, Word:<br>
praise to the Lord of my salvation,<br>
salvation is of Christ the Lord.</p>
