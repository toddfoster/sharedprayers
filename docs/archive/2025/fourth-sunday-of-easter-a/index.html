<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, &ldquo;Please come to us without delay.&rdquo; So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, &ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&rdquo; Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.</p>

I shall not be in want.<br>
<strong>2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *<br>
and leads me beside still waters.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

I shall fear no evil; *<br>
for you are with me;<br>
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *<br>
you have anointed my head with oil,<br>
and my cup is running over.<br>
<strong>6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *<br>
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-revelation-79-17">The Second Lesson: <em>Revelation 7:9-17</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom<br>
and thanksgiving and honor<br>
and power and might<br>
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.<br>
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;<br>
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,<br>
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &ldquo;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father&rsquo;s name testify to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father&rsquo;s hand. The Father and I are one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
