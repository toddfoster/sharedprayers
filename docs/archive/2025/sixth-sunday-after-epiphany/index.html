<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Thus says the LORD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their strength, whose hearts turn away from the LORD.<br>
They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief comes.<br>
They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.<br>
Blessed are those who trust in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.<br>
They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream.<br>
It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green;<br>
in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit.<br>
The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse&ndash; who can understand it?<br>
I the LORD test the mind and search the heart,<br>
to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="psalm-1">Psalm 1</h3>
<p><em>Beatus vir qui non abiit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the / wicked, *<br>
nor lingered in the way of sinners,<br>
nor sat in the seats of the / scornful!<br>
<strong>2	Their delight is in the law of the / LORD, *<br>
and they meditate on his law day and / night.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,<br>
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not / wither; *<br>
everything they do shall / prosper.<br>
<strong>4	It is not so with the / wicked; *<br>
they are like chaff which the wind blows a- / way.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment / comes, *<br>
nor the sinner in the council of the / righteous.<br>
<strong>6	For the LORD knows the way of the / righteous, *<br>
but the way of the wicked is / doomed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-1-corinthians-1512-20">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 15:12-20</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ&ndash;whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have died in Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>
<p>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died.</p>

<p>Jesus came down with the twelve apostles and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all in the crowd were trying to touch him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.</p>
<p>Then he looked up at his disciples and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.<br>
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.<br>
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.<br>
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&quot;<br>
&ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
