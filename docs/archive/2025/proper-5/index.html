<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from first Kings.</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came to Elijah, saying, &ldquo;Go now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live there; for I have commanded a widow there to feed you.&rdquo; So he set out and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, a widow was there gathering sticks; he called to her and said, &ldquo;Bring me a little water in a vessel, so that I may drink.&rdquo; As she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, &ldquo;Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&rdquo; But she said, &ldquo;As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&rdquo; Elijah said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son. For thus says the LORD the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.&rdquo; She went and did as Elijah said, so that she as well as he and her household ate for many days. The jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.</p>
<p>[After this, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house at Zarephath, became ill; his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. She then said to Elijah, &ldquo;What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!&rdquo; But he said to her, &ldquo;Give me your son.&rdquo; He took him from her bosom, carried him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging, and laid him on his own bed. He cried out to the LORD, &ldquo;O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?&rdquo; Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to the LORD, &ldquo;O LORD my God, let this child&rsquo;s life come into him again.&rdquo; The LORD listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived. Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; then Elijah said, &ldquo;See, your son is alive.&rdquo; So the woman said to Elijah, &ldquo;Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.&rdquo;]</p>

<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-galatians-111-24">The Second Lesson: <em>Galatians 1:11-24</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin; for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p>Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days; but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord&rsquo;s brother. In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ; they only heard it said, &ldquo;The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.&rdquo; And they glorified God because of me.</p>

<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-711-17">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 7:11-17</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Soon after healing the centurion&rsquo;s slave, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother&rsquo;s only son, and she was a widow; and with her was a large crowd from the town. When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, &ldquo;Do not weep.&rdquo; Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, &ldquo;Young man, I say to you, rise!&rdquo; The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, &ldquo;A great prophet has risen among us!&rdquo; and &ldquo;God has looked favorably on his people!&rdquo; This word about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.</p>
