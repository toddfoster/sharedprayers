I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.<br>
Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you,<br>
I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life.<br>
Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;<br>
I will say to the north, &ldquo;Give them up,&rdquo; and to the south, &ldquo;Do not withhold;<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. The two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>

Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death<br>
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.<br>
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are<br>
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his<br>
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.<br>
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his<br>
fellowship those who come to him in faith, baptizing them in<br>
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
