<h3 id="the-first-lesson-isaiah-1110-20">The First Lesson: <em>Isaiah 1:1,10-20</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom!<br>
Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!<br>
What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord;<br>
I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts;<br>
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.<br>
When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;<br>
bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me.<br>
New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation&ndash; I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.<br>
Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;<br>
they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.<br>
When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;<br>
even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.<br>
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes;<br>
cease to do evil, learn to do good;<br>
seek justice, rescue the oppressed,<br>
defend the orphan, plead for the widow.<br>
Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord:<br>
though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow;<br>
though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.<br>
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;<br>
but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="psalm-501-823-24">Psalm 50:1-8,23-24</h3>
<p><em>Deus deorum</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 The LORD, the God of gods, has spoken; *<br>
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.<br>
<strong>2 Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, *<br>
God reveals himself in glory.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Our God will come and will not keep silence; *<br>
before him there is a consuming flame,<br>
and round about him a raging storm.<br>
<strong>4 He calls the heavens and the earth from above *<br>
to witness the judgment of his people.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 &ldquo;Gather before me my loyal followers, *<br>
those who have made a covenant with me<br>
and sealed it with sacrifice.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>6 Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; *<br>
for God himself is judge.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak:<br>
&ldquo;O Israel, I will bear witness against you; *<br>
for I am God, your God.<br>
<strong>8 I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; *<br>
your offerings are always before me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23 Consider this well, you who forget God, *<br>
lest I rend you and there be none to deliver you.<br>
<strong>24 Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me; *<br>
but to those who keep in my way will I show the salvation of God.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-hebrews-111-38-16">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 11:1-3,8-16</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.</p>
<p>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, &ldquo;as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them. If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.&rdquo;</p>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>

and the life of the world to come. Amen.</strong></p>
