<p>A reading from the prophet Daniel.</p>
<p>In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.</p>
<p>As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-ephesians-111-23">The Second Lesson: <em>Ephesians 1:11-23</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.</p>
<p>I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>

<h5 id="people-7"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus looked up at his disciples and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.<br>
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.<br>
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.<br>
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&quot;<br>
&ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.<br>
&ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>

Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ, to lead us, through his death<br>
and resurrection, from the bondage of sin into everlasting life.<br>
We thank you, Father, for the water of Baptism. In it we are<br>
buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his<br>
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.<br>
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his<br>

the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

Take my hands, and let them move<br>

<p><strong>Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,<br>

Hosanna in the highest.<br>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-2"><strong>Celebrant and People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>We praise you, we bless you,<br>
we give thanks to you,<br>
and we pray to you, Lord our God.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-2">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>Remember Sean, our Presiding Bishop, Sally, our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.</p>
<p>Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.</p>
<p>Remember [<em>N. and</em>] all who this night have been united to Christ’s death in baptism, and so united to Christ’s risen life forever.</p>
<p>Remember all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.</p>
<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, with Blessed Thomas and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through Christ, and with Christ, and in Christ, all honor and glory are yours, Almighty God and Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.</p>
