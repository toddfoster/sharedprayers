<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said, &ldquo;Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.&rdquo; But the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do not say, &lsquo;I am only a boy&rsquo;; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you, Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&rdquo;</p>

In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; *<br>
let me never be ashamed.<br>
<strong>2<br>
In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *<br>
incline your ear to me and save me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *<br>
you are my crag and my stronghold.<br>
<strong>4<br>
Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *<br>
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5<br>
For you are my hope, O Lord GOD, *<br>
my confidence since I was young.<br>

I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;<br>
from my mother&rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *<br>
my praise shall be always of you.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-131-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 13:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>
<p>Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus began to speak in the synagogue at Nazareth: &ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&rdquo; All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They said, &ldquo;Is not this Joseph&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, &lsquo;Doctor, cure yourself!&rsquo; And you will say, &lsquo;Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.&rsquo;&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet&rsquo;s hometown. But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.&rdquo; When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage. They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff. But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.</p>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>

<p>At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.</p>

<p><strong>By your will they were created and have their being.</strong></p>
<h5 id="celebrant-5">Celebrant:</h5>
<p>From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.</p>
<h5 id="people-25"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.</strong></p>
<h5 id="celebrant-6">Celebrant:</h5>
<p>Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.</p>
<h5 id="people-26"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>By his blood, he reconciled us.<br>
By his wounds, we are healed.</strong></p>
<h5 id="celebrant-7">Celebrant:</h5>
<p>And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:</p>

<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

how passing thought and fantasy,<br>
that God, the Son of God, should take<br>
our mortal form for mortals&rsquo; sake!</p>

For us baptized, for us he bore<br>
his holy fast and hungered sore;<br>
for us temptations sharp he knew;<br>
for us the tempter overthrew.</p>
<p>3<br>
For us he prayed; for us he taught;<br>
for us his daily works he wrought:<br>
by words and signs and actions, thus<br>
still seeking not himself, but us.</p>
<p>4<br>
For us to wicked hands betrayed,<br>
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,<br>
he bore the shameful cross and death;<br>
for us gave up his dying breath.</p>
<p>5<br>
For us he rose from death again;<br>
for us he went on high to reign;<br>
for us he sent his Spirit here<br>
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.</p>
<p>6<br>
All glory to our Lord and God<br>
for love so deep, so high, so broad;<br>
the Trinity whom we adore<br>
forever and forevermore.</p>
