<p>My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick.<br>
Hark, the cry of my poor people from far and wide in the land:<br>
&ldquo;Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?&rdquo;<br>
(&ldquo;Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols?&rdquo;)<br>
&ldquo;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.&rdquo;<br>
For the hurt of my poor people I am hurt, I mourn, and dismay has taken hold of me.<br>
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?<br>
Why then has the health of my poor people not been restored?<br>
O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears,<br>
so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my poor people!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>1 O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance;<br>
they have profaned your holy temple; *<br>
they have made Jerusalem a heap of rubble.<br>
<strong>2 They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the air, *<br>
and the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the field.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 They have shed their blood like water on every side of Jerusalem, *<br>
and there was no one to bury them.<br>
<strong>4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, *<br>
an object of scorn and derision to those around us.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 How long will you be angry, O LORD? *<br>
will your fury blaze like fire for ever?<br>
<strong>6 Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not known you *<br>
and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>7 For they have devoured Jacob *<br>

let your compassion be swift to meet us; *<br>
for we have been brought very low.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>First of all, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind,<br>
Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all</p></blockquote>
<p>&ndash; this was attested at the right time. For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>

<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. So he summoned him and said to him, &lsquo;What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.&rsquo; Then the manager said to himself, &lsquo;What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.&rsquo; So, summoning his master&rsquo;s debtors one by one, he asked the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;A hundred jugs of olive oil.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.&rsquo; Then he asked another, &lsquo;And how much do you owe?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;A hundred containers of wheat.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill and make it eighty.&rsquo; And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

<p><strong>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

to love and serve you<br>
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
