<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. Thus says the LORD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me,<br>
and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?<br>
They did not say, &ldquo;Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>
who led us in the wilderness,<br>
in a land of deserts and pits,<br>
in a land of drought and deep darkness,<br>
in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?&rdquo;<br>
I brought you into a plentiful land<br>
to eat its fruits and its good things.<br>
But when you entered you defiled my land,<br>
and made my heritage an abomination.<br>
The priests did not say, &ldquo;Where is the LORD?&rdquo;<br>
Those who handle the law did not know me;<br>
the rulers transgressed against me;<br>
the prophets prophesied by Baal,<br>
and went after things that do not profit.</p>
<p>Therefore once more I accuse you, says the LORD,<br>
and I accuse your children&rsquo;s children.<br>
Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look,<br>
send to Kedar and examine with care;<br>
see if there has ever been such a thing.<br>
Has a nation changed its gods,<br>
even though they are no gods?<br>
But my people have changed their glory<br>
for something that does not profit.<br>
Be appalled, O heavens, at this,<br>
be shocked, be utterly desolate,<br>
says the LORD,<br>
for my people have committed two evils:<br>
they have forsaken me,<br>
the fountain of living water,<br>
and dug out cisterns for themselves,<br>
cracked cisterns<br>
that can hold no water.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>1	Sing with joy to God our / strength *<br>
and raise a loud shout to the God of / Jacob.<br>
<strong>10	I am the LORD your God,<br>
who brought you out of the land of Egypt and / said, *<br>
&ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I will / fill it.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	And yet my people did not hear my / voice, *<br>
and Israel would not o- / bey me.<br>
<strong>12	So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their  / hearts, *<br>

that Israel would walk in my / ways!<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Let mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured. Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, &ldquo;I will never leave you or forsake you.&rdquo; So we can say with confidence,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.<br>
What can anyone do to me?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</p>
<p>Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.</p>

<p>On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were watching him closely.</p>
<p>When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. &ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, &lsquo;Give this person your place,&rsquo; and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, &lsquo;Friend, move up higher&rsquo;; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said also to the one who had invited him, &ldquo;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>

he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>

he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
