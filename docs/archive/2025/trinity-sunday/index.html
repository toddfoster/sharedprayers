<h3 id="the-first-lesson-proverbs-81-422-31">The First Lesson: <em>Proverbs 8:1-4,22-31</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?<br>
On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;<br>
beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out:<br>
&ldquo;To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live.<br>
The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.<br>
Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.<br>
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.<br>
Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth&ndash;<br>
when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world&rsquo;s first bits of soil.<br>
When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,<br>
when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,<br>
when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command,<br>
when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master worker;<br>
and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,<br>
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-romans-51-5">The Second Lesson: <em>Romans 5:1-5</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.</p>

When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
