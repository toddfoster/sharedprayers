<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>When the temple police had brought the apostles, they had them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them, saying, &ldquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man&rsquo;s blood on us.&rdquo; But Peter and the apostles answered, &ldquo;We must obey God rather than any human authority. The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&rdquo; Thomas answered him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
