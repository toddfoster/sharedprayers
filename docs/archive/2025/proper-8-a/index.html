<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from second Kings.</p>
<p>When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.&rdquo; But Elisha said, &ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p>Then Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.</p>
<p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.&rdquo; Elisha said, &ldquo;Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.&rdquo; As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, &ldquo;Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo; But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</p>
<p>He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, &ldquo;Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&rdquo; When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 15: The Song of Mary</strong> &ndash; <em>Magnificat</em> (Luke 1:46-55)</p>
<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paulâ€™s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>
<p>For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.</p>
<p>Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.</p>

<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-951-62">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 9:51-62</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Lukeâ€™s Gospel.</p>
<p>When the days drew near for Jesus to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.</p>
<p>As they were going along the road, someone said to him, &ldquo;I will follow you wherever you go.&rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&rdquo; To another he said, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&rdquo; But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
