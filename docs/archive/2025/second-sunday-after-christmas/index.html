<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Thus says the LORD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations;<br>
proclaim, give praise, and say, &ldquo;Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel.&rdquo;<br>
See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,<br>
among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.<br>
With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back,<br>
I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;<br>
for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.<br>
Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away;<br>
say, &ldquo;He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock.&rdquo;<br>
For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.<br>
They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD,<br>
over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd;<br>
their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.<br>
Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry.<br>
I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.<br>
I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty,</p></blockquote>
<p>says the LORD.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.</p>
<p>I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe.</p>

<p>After the wise men had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, &ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee. There he made his home in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, &ldquo;He will be called a Nazorean.&rdquo;</p>

he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
