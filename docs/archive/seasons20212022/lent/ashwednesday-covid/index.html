<p>A reading from the prophet Joel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blow the trumpet in Zion;<br>
sound the alarm on my holy mountain!<br>
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,<br>
for the day of the Lord is coming, it is near—<br>
a day of darkness and gloom,<br>
a day of clouds and thick darkness!<br>
Like blackness spread upon the mountains<br>
a great and powerful army comes;<br>
their like has never been from of old,<br>
nor will be again after them<br>
in ages to come.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet even now, says the Lord,<br>
return to me with all your heart,<br>
with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;<br>
rend your hearts and not your clothing.<br>
Return to the Lord, your God,<br>
for he is gracious and merciful,<br>
slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love,<br>
and relents from punishing.<br>
Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,<br>
and leave a blessing behind him,<br>
a grain-offering and a drink-offering<br>
for the Lord, your God?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blow the trumpet in Zion;<br>
sanctify a fast;<br>
call a solemn assembly;<br>
gather the people.<br>
Sanctify the congregation;<br>
assemble the aged;<br>
gather the children,<br>
even infants at the breast.<br>
Let the bridegroom leave his room,<br>
and the bride her canopy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Between the vestibule and the altar<br>
let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep.<br>
Let them say, ‘Spare your people, O Lord,<br>
and do not make your heritage a mockery,<br>
a byword among the nations.<br>
Why should it be said among the peoples,<br>
“Where is their God?”’</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *<br>
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.<br>
<strong>2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *<br>
and forget not all his benefits.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He forgives all your sins *<br>
and heals all your infirmities;<br>
<strong>4	He redeems your life from the grave *<br>
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He satisfies you with good things, *<br>
and your youth is renewed like an eagle&rsquo;s.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD executes righteousness *<br>
and judgment for all who are oppressed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	He made his ways known to Moses *<br>
and his works to the children of Israel.<br>
<strong>8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *<br>
slow to anger and of great kindness.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	He will not always accuse us, *<br>
nor will he keep his anger for ever.<br>
<strong>10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *<br>
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *<br>
so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.<br>
<strong>12	As far as the east is from the west, *<br>
so far has he removed our sins from us.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	As a father cares for his children, *<br>
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.<br>
<strong>14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *<br>
he remembers that we are but dust.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Our days are like the grass; *<br>
we flourish like a flower of the field;<br>
<strong>16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *<br>
and its place shall know it no more.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever<br>
on those who fear him, *<br>
and his righteousness on children&rsquo;s children;<br>
<strong>18	On those who keep his covenant *<br>
and remember his commandments and do them.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *<br>
and his kingship has dominion over all.<br>
<strong>20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,<br>
you mighty ones who do his bidding, *<br>
and hearken to the voice of his word.</strong></p></blockquote>

bless the LORD, O my soul.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘At an acceptable time I have listened to you,<br>
and on a day of salvation I have helped you.’</p></blockquote>
<p>See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labours, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see—we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear People of God: The first Christians observed with great devotion the days of our Lord’s passion and resurrection, and it became the custom of the Church to prepare for them by a season of penitence and fasting. This season of Lent provided a time in which converts to the faith were prepared for Holy Baptism. It was also a time when those who, because of notorious sins, had been separated from the body of the faithful were reconciled by penitence and forgiveness, and restored to the fellowship of the Church. Thereby, the whole congregation was put in mind of the message of pardon and absolution set forth in the Gospel of our Savior, and of the need which all Christians continually have to renew their repentance and faith.</p>
<p>I invite you, therefore, in the name of the Church, to the observance of a holy Lent, by self-examination and repentance; by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and meditating on God’s holy Word. And, to make a right beginning of repentance, and as a mark of our mortal nature, let us now kneel before the Lord, our maker and redeemer.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 51<br>
<em>Miserere mei, Deus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your loving-kindness; *<br>
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.<br>
<strong>2	Wash me through and through from my wickedness *<br>
and cleanse me from my sin.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	For I know my transgressions, *<br>
and my sin is ever before me.<br>
<strong>4	Against you only have I sinned *<br>
and done what is evil in your sight.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	And so you are justified when you speak *<br>
and upright in your judgment.<br>
<strong>6	Indeed, I have been wicked from my birth, *<br>
a sinner from my mother&rsquo;s womb.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	For behold, you look for truth deep within me, *<br>
and will make me understand wisdom secretly<br>
<strong>8	Purge me from my sin, and I shall be pure; *<br>
wash me, and I shall be clean indeed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Make me hear of joy and gladness, *<br>
that the body you have broken may rejoice.<br>
<strong>10	Hide your face from my sins *<br>
and blot out all my iniquities.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Create in me a clean heart, O God, *<br>
and renew a right spirit within me.<br>
<strong>12	Cast me not away from your presence *<br>
and take not your holy Spirit from me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Give me the joy of your saving help again *<br>
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.<br>
<strong>14	I shall teach your ways to the wicked, *<br>
and sinners shall return to you.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Deliver me from death, O God, *<br>
and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness,<br>
O God of my salvation.<br>
<strong>16	Open my lips, O Lord, *<br>
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	Had you desired it, I would have offered sacrifice, *<br>
but you take no delight in burnt-offerings.<br>
<strong>18	The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *<br>
a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Presider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Christ has died.<br>
Christ is risen.<br>
Christ will come again.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Presider continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Presider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AMEN.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="if-a-person-desires-to-receive-the-sacrament-but-by-reason-of-extreme-sickness-or-physical-disability-is-unable-to-eat-and-drink-the-bread-and-wine-the-celebrant-is-to-assure-that-person-that-all-the-benefits-of-communion-are-received-even-though-the-sacrament-is-not-received-with-the-mouth-bcp-457">If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
