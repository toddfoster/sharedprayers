<p>1<br>
O little town of Bethlehem,<br>
how still we see thee lie!<br>
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br>
the silent stars go by;<br>
yet in thy dark streets shineth<br>
the everlasting Light;<br>
the hopes and fears of all the years<br>
are met in thee tonight.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
For Christ is born of Mary;<br>
and gathered all above,<br>
while mortals sleep, the angels keep<br>
their watch of wondering love.<br>
O morning stars, together<br>
proclaim the holy birth!<br>
and praises sing to God the King,<br>
and peace to men on earth.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
How silently, how silently,<br>
the wondrous Gift is given!<br>
So God imparts to human hearts<br>
the blessings of his heaven.<br>
No ear may hear his coming,<br>
but in this world of sin,<br>
where meek souls will receive him, still<br>
the dear Christ enters in.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The people who walked in darkness<br>
have seen a great light;<br>
those who lived in a land of deep darkness&ndash;<br>
on them light has shined.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have multiplied the nation,<br>
you have increased its joy;<br>

as with joy at the harvest,<br>
as people exult when dividing plunder.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

and the bar across their shoulders,<br>
the rod of their oppressor,<br>
you have broken as on the day of Midian.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the boots of the tramping warriors<br>
and all the garments rolled in blood<br>
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.</p></blockquote>

a son given to us;<br>
authority rests upon his shoulders;<br>
and he is named<br>
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,<br>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His authority shall grow continually,<br>
and there shall be endless peace<br>
for the throne of David and his kingdom.</p></blockquote>

sing to the Lord, all the whole earth.<br>

proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Declare his glory among the nations *<br>
and his wonders among all peoples.<br>
4 <strong>For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised; *<br>
he is more to be feared than all gods.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *<br>
but it is the Lord who made the heavens.<br>
6 <strong>Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *<br>
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 Ascribe to the Lord, you families of the peoples; *<br>
ascribe to the Lord honor and power.<br>
8 <strong>Ascribe to the Lord the honor due his Name; *<br>
bring offerings and come into his courts.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; *<br>
let the whole earth tremble before him.<br>
<strong>10 Tell it out among the nations: &ldquo;The Lord is King! *<br>
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;<br>
he will judge the peoples with equity.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;<br>
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *<br>
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.<br>

before the Lord when he comes, *<br>
when he comes to judge the earth.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven,<br>
and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<h5 id="the-presider-continues-2">The Presider continues:</h5>
<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
<h5 id="presider-5">Presider:</h5>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="if-a-person-desires-to-receive-the-sacrament-but-by-reason-of-extreme-sickness-or-physical-disability-is-unable-to-eat-and-drink-the-bread-and-wine-the-celebrant-is-to-assure-that-person-that-all-the-benefits-of-communion-are-received-even-though-the-sacrament-is-not-received-with-the-mouth-bcp-457">If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
