<p>I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;<br>
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.<br>
Then the LORD answered me and said:<br>
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.<br>
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.<br>
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.<br>
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<p>Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. For yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in a very little while,<br>
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;<br>
but my righteous one will live by faith.<br>
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.</p>
<p>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</p>

<p>A reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”</p>
<p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”</p>
