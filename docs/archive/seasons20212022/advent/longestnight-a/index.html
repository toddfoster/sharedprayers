<h3 id="about-the-longest-night">About the Longest Night</h3>
<p>The <strong>winter solstice</strong> happens around 21 December every year. This is the longest night of the year, before the nights start getting shorter and the days longer. The Advent and Christmas seasons can feel like long, dark nights for those who find themselves out of step with the persistent and often artificial “cheer” of the season that assaults us from every side. The backdrop of traditions and cheeriness can remind us of our own losses and sadness. The added stresses of the continuing pandemic, politics, unrest, and visible injustice add to our weight of sadness.</p>
<p>The <strong>Nativity of our Lord</strong> was a time for rejoicing, but it also involved much fear, sadness, anxiety, and terror. The Incarnation of our Lord meant that God in the flesh would experience the full range of human emotions, joining us in our mourning as well as in our joy.</p>
<p>The <strong>Longest Night Mass</strong> is intended to bring balance to our Advent and Christmas observances, making space for those emotions which don’t fit into the advertisers’ profit motive, but are very much a part of our lives. Sadness, emptiness, and even depression are valid, important emotions for Christians. They are God-given and correspond to the very real challenges and brokenness in our lives. You are welcome here.</p>
<p>St. Thomas’ mission and ministry is completely funded by its members and guests. If you would like to contribute to the work we do, you can find an offering basin behind the last pew before the offertory, or you can <a href="https://donate.stthomasglassboro.org">give online</a>.</p>

<p>A reading from the book of Lamentations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am one who has seen affliction under the rod of God&rsquo;s wrath;<br>
he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;<br>
against me alone he turns his hand, again and again, all day long.<br>
He has made my flesh and my skin waste away, and broken my bones;<br>
he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;<br>
he has made me sit in darkness like the dead of long ago.<br>
He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has put heavy chains on me;<br>
though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;<br>
he has blocked my ways with hewn stones, he has made my paths crooked.<br>
The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!<br>
My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.<br>
But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:<br>
The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;<br>
they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.<br>
&ldquo;The LORD is my portion,&rdquo; says my soul, &ldquo;therefore I will hope in him.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, some two miles away, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home. Martha said to Jesus, ‘Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask of him.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Your brother will rise again.’ Martha said to him, ‘I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.’ Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?’ She said to him, ‘Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.’</p>
<p>When she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, and told her privately, ‘The Teacher is here and is calling for you.’ And when she heard it, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. The Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go out. They followed her because they thought that she was going to the tomb to weep there. When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, ‘Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.’ When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. He said, ‘Where have you laid him?’ They said to him, ‘Lord, come and see.’ Jesus began to weep.</p>

<p>We light this first Advent candle to remember those persons who have been loved and lost. We pause to remember their names, their faces, their voices. We give thanks for the memory that binds them to us this during season which anticipates Christmas.</p>
<h5 id="people-5"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>May God’s eternal love surround them.</strong></p>
<h5 id="presider-2">Presider:</h5>
<p>We light the second candle to redeem the pain of loss: the loss of relationships, the loss of jobs, the loss of health. As we gather up the pain of the past, we offer it to you, O God, asking that into our open hands you will place the gift of peace.</p>
<h5 id="people-6"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Refresh, restore, renew us, O God, and lead us into your future.</strong></p>

<p>We light this third candle to remember ourselves this Christmas time. We pause and remember the past weeks, months and for some of us, years of difficult times. We remember the poignancy of memories, the grief, the sadness, the hurts, the pain of reflecting on our own mortality.</p>
<h5 id="people-7"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Let us remember that dawn defeats darkness.</strong></p>
<h5 id="presider-4">Presider:</h5>
<p>This fourth candle is lit to remember our faith and the gift of hope which God offers to us in the Christmas story. We remember that God, who shares our life, promises us a place and time of no more pain and suffering.</p>
<h5 id="people-8"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Let us remember the one who shows the way and who goes with us into our tomorrows.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Christ candle will remain unlit as a sign of waiting for a future that is yet unknown to us, toward which God beckons us.</em></p>
<p><em>The priest will light a candle of remembrance and place it in the basin on the altar. If you so desire, you may take a candle from the basket, light it from the candles in the Advent Wreath, and place it in the basin to represent a memory, concern or burden of heart that you wish to place on the altar for God’s tender ministrations.</em></p>

<h5 id="then-the-presider-continues">Then the Presider continues:</h5>
<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p>
<h5 id="presider-and-people-1">Presider and <strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>We praise you, we bless you,<br>
we give thanks to you,<br>
and we pray to you, Lord our God.</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-presider-continues-1">The Presider continues:</h5>
<p>Lord, we pray that in your goodness and mercy your Holy Spirit may descend upon us, and upon these gifts, sanctifying them and showing them to be holy gifts for your holy people, the bread of life and the cup of salvation, the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>
<p>Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ. Reveal its unity, guard its faith, and preserve it in peace.</p>
<p>Remember those whom we now name, silently or aloud: all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.</p>
<p><em>The people are invited to call aloud names they wish to add to the prayer.</em></p>

<p>And grant that we may find our inheritance with the Blessed Virgin Mary, with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs,  with Blessed Thomas, and all the saints who have found favor with you in ages past. We praise you in union with them and give you glory through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p><strong>Almighty God, we thank you that in your great love you have fed us with the spiritual food and drink of the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ, and have given us a foretaste of your heavenly banquet. Grant that this Sacrament may be to us a comfort in affliction, and a pledge of our inheritance in that kingdom where there is no death, neither sorrow nor crying, but the fullness of joy with all your saints; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</strong></p>
