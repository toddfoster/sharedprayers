<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Revelation 7:9-17</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from John&rsquo;s Revelation.</p>
<p>After this I, John, looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,<br>
&ldquo;Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!&rdquo; And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom<br>
and thanksgiving and honor<br>
and power and might<br>
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason they are before the throne of God,<br>
and worship him day and night within his temple,<br>
and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.<br>
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;<br>
the sun will not strike them,<br>
nor any scorching heat;<br>
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,<br>
and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,<br>
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 34:1-10 ,22<br>
<em>Benedicam Dominum</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 I will bless the Lord at all times; *<br>
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.<br>
<strong>2 I will glory in the Lord; *<br>
let the humble hear and rejoice.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Proclaim with me the greatness of the Lord; *<br>
let us exalt his Name together.<br>
<strong>4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me *<br>
and delivered me out of all my terror.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Look upon him and be radiant, *<br>
and let not your faces be ashamed.<br>
<strong>6 I called in my affliction and the Lord heard me *<br>
and saved me from all my troubles.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 The angel of the Lord encompasses those who fear him, *<br>
and he will deliver them.<br>
<strong>8 Taste and see that the Lord is good; *<br>
happy are they who trust in him!</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Fear the Lord, you that are his saints, *<br>
for those who fear him lack nothing.<br>
<strong>10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger, *<br>
but those who seek the Lord lack nothing that is good.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>22 The Lord ransoms the life of his servants, *<br>
and none will be punished who trust in him.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 John 3:1-3</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
&ldquo;Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power. Your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love. You formed us in your own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all your creatures. When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you. This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption. Recalling Christ’s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.<br>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em></p></blockquote>
