<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong>	&mdash; <em>Jeremiah 31:1-6 NRSV</em><br>
Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. Thus says the Lord: The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; when Israel sought for rest, the Lord appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you. Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin Israel! Again you shall take your tambourines, and go forth in the dance of the merrymakers. Again you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit. For there shall be a day when sentinels will call in the hill country of Ephraim:<br>
“Come, let us go up to Zion,<br>
to the Lord our God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 118:1-2, 14-24</strong> &mdash; <em>Confitemini Domino</em> &mdash; <em>(BCP	760)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *<br>
his mercy endures for ever.<br>
<strong>2 Let Israel now proclaim, *<br>
&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>14 The Lord is my strength and my song, *<br>
and he has become my salvation.<br>
<strong>15 There is a sound of exultation and victory *<br>
in the tents of the righteous:</strong></p>
<p>16 &ldquo;The right hand of the Lord has triumphed! *<br>
the right hand of the Lord is exalted!<br>
the right hand of the Lord has triumphed!&rdquo;<br>
<strong>17 I shall not die, but live, *<br>
and declare the works of the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>18 The Lord has punished me sorely, *<br>
but he did not hand me over to death.<br>
<strong>19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *<br>
I will enter them;<br>
I will offer thanks to the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>20 &ldquo;This is the gate of the Lord; *<br>
he who is righteous may enter.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *<br>
and have become my salvation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>Acts 10:34-43 NRSV</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the book of Acts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; *<br>
you are worthy of praise; glory to you.<br>
Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; *<br>
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; *<br>
on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.<br>
Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; *<br>
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to you, beholding the depths; *<br>
in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.<br>
Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; *<br>
we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Third Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>John 20:1-18 NRSV</em><br>
Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.</p>
<p>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>
