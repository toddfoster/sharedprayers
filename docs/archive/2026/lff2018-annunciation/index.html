<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”</p>

<strong>2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *<br>
who speaks the truth from his heart.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	There is no guile upon his tongue;<br>
he does no evil to his friend; *<br>
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.<br>
<strong>4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *<br>
but he honors those who fear the LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>5	He has sworn to do no wrong *<br>
and does not take back his word.<br>
<strong>6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *<br>
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-hebrews-105-10">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 10:5-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>When Christ came into the world, he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;<br>
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.<br>
Then I said, &lsquo;See, God, I have come to do your will, O God&rsquo; (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>When he said above, &ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
