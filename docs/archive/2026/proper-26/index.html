<h3 id="the-first-lesson-joshua-37-17">The First Lesson: <em>Joshua 3:7-17</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Joshua.</p>
<p>The LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses. You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’” Joshua then said to the Israelites, “Draw near and hear the words of the LORD your God.” Joshua said, “By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites: the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan. So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap.”</p>
<p>When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people. Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho. While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.</p>

<h3 id="psalm-1071-733-37">Psalm 107:1-7,33-37</h3>
<p><em>Confitemini Domino</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *<br>
and his mercy endures for ever.<br>
<strong>2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim *<br>
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 He gathered them out of the lands; *<br>
from the east and from the west,<br>
from the north and from the south.<br>
<strong>4 Some wandered in desert wastes; *<br>
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 They were hungry and thirsty; *<br>
their spirits languished within them.<br>
<strong>6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *<br>
and he delivered them from their distress.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 He put their feet on a straight path *<br>
to go to a city where they might dwell.<br>
<strong>33 The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *<br>
and water-springs into thirsty ground,</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>34 A fruitful land into salt flats, *<br>
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.<br>
<strong>35 He changed deserts into pools of water *<br>
and dry land into water-springs.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>36 He settled the hungry there, *<br>
and they founded a city to dwell in.<br>
<strong>37 They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *<br>
and brought in a fruitful harvest.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>You remember our labor and toil, brothers and sisters; we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how pure, upright, and blameless our conduct was toward you believers. As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children, urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</p>
<p>We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God&rsquo;s word, which is also at work in you believers.</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses&rsquo; seat; therefore, do whatever they teach you and follow it; but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they teach. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. They do all their deeds to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long. They love to have the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all students. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father&ndash; the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. All who exalt themselves will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
