<blockquote>
<p>When Jesus and his disciples had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, `The Lord needs them.&rsquo; And he will send them immediately.&rdquo; This took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the daughter of Zion,<br>
Look, your king is coming to you,<br>
humble, and mounted on a donkey,<br>
and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!<br>

Hosanna in the highest heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; The crowds were saying, &ldquo;This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.&rdquo;<br>

Morning by morning he wakens&ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.<br>
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.<br>
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;<br>
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.<br>
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;<br>
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.<br>
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,<br>
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.<br>
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.<br>
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,<br>
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
