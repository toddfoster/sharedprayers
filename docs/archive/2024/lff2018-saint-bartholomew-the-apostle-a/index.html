<p>1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *<br>
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
<strong>2	He shall say to the LORD,<br>
&ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *<br>
my God in whom I put my trust.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *<br>
and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
<strong>4	He shall cover you with his pinions,<br>
and you shall find refuge under his wings; *<br>
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *<br>
nor of the arrow that flies by day;<br>

nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	A thousand shall fall at your side<br>
and ten thousand at your right hand, *<br>
but it shall not come near you.<br>
<strong>8	Your eyes have only to behold *<br>
to see the reward of the wicked.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *<br>
and the Most High your habitation,<br>
<strong>10	There shall no evil happen to you, *<br>
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, *<br>
to keep you in all your ways.<br>
<strong>12	They shall bear you in their hands, *<br>
lest you dash your foot against a stone.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *<br>
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.<br>
<strong>14	Because he is bound to me in love,<br>
therefore will I deliver him; *<br>
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *<br>
I am with him in trouble;<br>
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.<br>

and show him my salvation.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the LORD replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command.</p>

<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-1-corinthians-49-15">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 4:9-15</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.</p>
<p>I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</p>

<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-2224-30">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 22:24-30</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>A dispute arose among the disciples as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</p>
<p>“You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</p>
