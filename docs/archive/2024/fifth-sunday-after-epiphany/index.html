<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?<br>
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;<br>
who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in;<br>
who brings princes to naught, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.<br>
Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,<br>
when he blows upon them, and they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble.<br>
To whom then will you compare me, or who is my equal? says the Holy One.<br>
Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these?<br>
He who brings out their host and numbers them, calling them all by name;<br>
because he is great in strength, mighty in power, not one is missing.<br>
Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel,<br>
&ldquo;My way is hidden from the LORD, and my right is disregarded by my God&rdquo;?<br>
Have you not known? Have you not heard?<br>
The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.<br>
He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.<br>
He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.<br>
Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted;<br>
but those who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles,<br>
they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel! For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.</p>
<p>For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God&rsquo;s law but am under Christ&rsquo;s law) so that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.</p>

<p>After Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</p>
<p>That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered around the door. And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed. And Simon and his companions hunted for him. When they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is searching for you.” He answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.” And he went throughout Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

of all that is, seen and unseen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>
the only Son of God,<br>
eternally begotten of the Father,<br>
God from God,<br>
Light from Light, true God from true God,<br>
begotten, not made,<br>
of one Being with the Father.<br>
Through him all things were made.<br>
For us and for our salvation<br>
he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
