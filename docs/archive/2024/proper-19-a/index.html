<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.<br>
At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:<br>
“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?<br>
How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?<br>
Give heed to my reproof;<br>
I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.<br>
Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,<br>
and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,<br>
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,<br>
when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.<br>
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.<br>
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,<br>
would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,<br>
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.<br>
For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;<br>
but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster.”</p>

<p><em>Caeli enarrant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *<br>
and the firmament shows his handiwork.<br>
<strong>2	One day tells its tale to another, *<br>
and one night imparts knowledge to another.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Although they have no words or language, *<br>
and their voices are not heard,<br>
<strong>4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *<br>
and their message to the ends of the world.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *<br>
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;<br>
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.<br>
<strong>6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens<br>
and runs about to the end of it again; *<br>
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The law of the LORD is perfect<br>
and revives the soul; *<br>
the testimony of the LORD is sure<br>
and gives wisdom to the innocent.<br>
<strong>8	The statutes of the LORD are just<br>
and rejoice the heart; *<br>
the commandment of the LORD is clear<br>
and gives light to the eyes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The fear of the LORD is clean<br>
and endures for ever; *<br>
the judgments of the LORD are true<br>
and righteous altogether.<br>
<strong>10	More to be desired are they than gold,<br>
more than much fine gold, *<br>
sweeter far than honey,<br>
than honey in the comb.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *<br>
and in keeping them there is great reward.<br>
<strong>12	Who can tell how often he offends? *<br>
cleanse me from my secret faults.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;<br>
let them not get dominion over me; *<br>
then shall I be whole and sound,<br>
and innocent of a great offense.<br>
<strong>14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>
be acceptable in your sight, *<br>
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle of James.</p>
<p>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies. Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.</p>
<p>How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell. For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue&ndash; a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water? Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.</p>

<p>Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they answered him, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah.” And he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.</p>
<p>Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”</p>
<p>He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
