<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me;<br>
he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted,<br>
to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;<br>
to proclaim the year of the LORD&rsquo;s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;<br>
to provide for those who mourn in Zion— to give them a garland instead of ashes,<br>
the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.<br>
They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.<br>
They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations;<br>
they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.<br>
For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing;<br>
I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.<br>
Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples;<br>
all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed.<br>
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God;<br>
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,<br>
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.<br>
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,<br>
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.</p></blockquote>

<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise the words of prophets, but test everything; hold fast to what is good; abstain from every form of evil.</p>
<p>May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.</p>
<p>This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Messiah.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” He answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’” as the prophet Isaiah said. Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him, “Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know, the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.” This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.</p>

buried with Christ in his death. By it we share in his<br>
resurrection. Through it we are reborn by the Holy Spirit.<br>
Therefore in joyful obedience to your Son, we bring into his<br>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
