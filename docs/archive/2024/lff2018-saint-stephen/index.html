<blockquote>
<p>1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;<br>
let me never be put to shame; *<br>
deliver me in your righteousness.<br>
<strong>2	Incline your ear to me; *<br>
make haste to deliver me.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,<br>
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *<br>
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.<br>
<strong>4	Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *<br>
for you are my tower of strength.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Into your hands I commend my spirit, *<br>
for you have redeemed me,<br>
O LORD, O God of truth.<br>
<strong>6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *<br>
and I put my trust in the LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *<br>
for you have seen my affliction;<br>
you know my distress.<br>
<strong>8	You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *<br>
you have set my feet in an open place.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *<br>
my eye is consumed with sorrow,<br>
and also my throat and my belly.<br>
<strong>10	For my life is wasted with grief,<br>
and my years with sighing; *<br>
my strength fails me because of affliction,<br>
and my bones are consumed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors,<br>
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *<br>
when they see me in the street they avoid me.<br>
<strong>12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *<br>
I am as useless as a broken pot.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;<br>
fear is all around; *<br>
they put their heads together against me;<br>
they plot to take my life.<br>
<strong>14	But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *<br>
I have said, &ldquo;You are my God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	My times are in your hand; *<br>
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,<br>
and from those who persecute me.<br>
<strong>16	Make your face to shine upon your servant, *<br>
and in your loving-kindness save me.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *<br>
rather, let the wicked be put to shame;<br>
let them be silent in the grave.<br>
<strong>18	Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against the righteous, *<br>
haughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	How great is your goodness, O LORD!<br>
which you have laid up for those who fear you; *<br>
which you have done in the sight of all<br>
for those who put their trust in you.<br>
<strong>20	You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who slander them; *<br>
you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21	Blessed be the LORD! *<br>
for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged city.<br>
<strong>22	Yet I said in my alarm,<br>
I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.&quot; *<br>
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty<br>
when I cried out to you.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23	Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *<br>
the LORD protects the faithful,<br>
but repays to the full those who act haughtily.<br>
<strong>24	Be strong and let your heart take courage, *<br>
all you who wait for the LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>

Truly I tell you, all this will come upon this generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you, desolate.

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food<br>
of the most precious Body and Blood<br>
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;<br>
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries<br>
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,<br>
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.<br>
And now, Father, send us out<br>
to do the work you have given us to do,<br>
to love and serve you<br>
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
