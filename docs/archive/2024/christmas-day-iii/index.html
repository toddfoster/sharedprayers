<p>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,<br>

Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;<br>

Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;<br>
for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.<br>
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations;<br>
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-11-45-12_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 1:1-4,(5-12)</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>
<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or again,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let all God&rsquo;s angels worship him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the angels he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of the Son he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;<br>
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;<br>
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.<br>
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.</p>
<p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.</p>
<p>He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
