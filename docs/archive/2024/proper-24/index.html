<p>A reading from the book of Job.</p>
<p>The LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?<br>
Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.<br>
&ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.<br>
Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?<br>
On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone<br>
when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?<br>
[“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that a flood of waters may cover you?<br>
Can you send forth lightnings, so that they may go and say to you, ‘Here we are’?<br>
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts, or given understanding to the mind?<br>
Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens,<br>
when the dust runs into a mass and the clods cling together?<br>
“Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br>
when they crouch in their dens, or lie in wait in their covert?<br>
Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God, and wander about for lack of food?”]</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_hebrews-51-10_">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 5:1-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness; and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
<p>So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are my Son, today I have begotten you”;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as he says also in another place,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?” And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.” But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p>
<p>When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
