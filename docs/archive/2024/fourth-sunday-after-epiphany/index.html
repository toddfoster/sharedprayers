<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>Moses said: The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the LORD replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command. Anyone who does not heed the words that the prophet shall speak in my name, I myself will hold accountable. But any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, or who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded the prophet to speak—that prophet shall die.”</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-1-corinthians-81-13">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 8:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. Anyone who claims to know something does not yet have the necessary knowledge; but anyone who loves God is known by him.</p>
<p>Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “no idol in the world really exists,” and that “there is no God but one.” Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as in fact there are many gods and many lords— yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</p>
<p>It is not everyone, however, who has this knowledge. Since some have become so accustomed to idols until now, they still think of the food they eat as food offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. “Food will not bring us close to God.” We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For if others see you, who possess knowledge, eating in the temple of an idol, might they not, since their conscience is weak, be encouraged to the point of eating food sacrificed to idols? So by your knowledge those weak believers for whom Christ died are destroyed. But when you thus sin against members of your family, and wound their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food is a cause of their falling, I will never eat meat, so that I may not cause one of them to fall.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.” But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</p>

<p>At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses, and this fragile earth, our island home.</p>

<p><strong>By your will they were created and have their being.</strong></p>

<p>From the primal elements you brought forth the human race, and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill. You made us the rulers of creation. But we turned against you, and betrayed your trust; and we turned against one another.</p>
<h5 id="people-25"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.</strong></p>
<h5 id="celebrant-6">Celebrant:</h5>
<p>Again and again, you called us to return. Through prophets and sages you revealed your righteous Law. And in the fullness of time you sent your only Son, born of a woman, to fulfill your Law, to open for us the way of freedom and peace.</p>
<h5 id="people-26"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>By his blood, he reconciled us.<br>
By his wounds, we are healed.</strong></p>
<h5 id="celebrant-7">Celebrant:</h5>
<p>And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:</p>

<p>And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Deliver us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for renewal. Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one body, one spirit in Christ, that we may worthily serve the<br>

O love, how deep, how broad, how high,<br>
how passing thought and fantasy,<br>
that God, the Son of God, should take<br>
our mortal form for mortals&rsquo; sake!</p>
<p>2<br>
For us baptized, for us he bore<br>
his holy fast and hungered sore;<br>
for us temptations sharp he knew;<br>
for us the tempter overthrew.</p>
<p>3<br>
For us he prayed; for us he taught;<br>
for us his daily works he wrought:<br>
by words and signs and actions, thus<br>
still seeking not himself, but us.</p>
<p>4<br>
For us to wicked hands betrayed,<br>
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,<br>
he bore the shameful cross and death;<br>
for us gave up his dying breath.</p>
<p>5<br>
For us he rose from death again;<br>
for us he went on high to reign;<br>
for us he sent his Spirit here<br>
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.</p>
<p>6<br>
All glory to our Lord and God<br>
for love so deep, so high, so broad;<br>
the Trinity whom we adore<br>
forever and forevermore.</p>
