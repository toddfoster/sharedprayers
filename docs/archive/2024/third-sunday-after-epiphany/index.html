<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Jonah.</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying, “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days&rsquo; walk across. Jonah began to go into the city, going a day&rsquo;s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!” And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.</p>
<p>When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.</p>

<p>After John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”</p>
<p>As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you fish for people.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.</p>

he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>

he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>

the poor and them that mourn,<br>
the faint and overborne,<br>
sin-sick and sorrow-worn,<br>
whom Christ doth heal.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with fervent prayer;<br>
the wayward and the lost,<br>
by restless passions tossed,<br>
redeemed at countless cost,<br>
from dark despair.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with one accord;<br>
with us the work to share,<br>
with us reproach to dare,<br>
with us the cross to bear,<br>
for Christ our Lord.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
Christ for the world we sing!<br>
The world to Christ we bring<br>
with joyful song;<br>
the newborn souls, whose days,<br>
reclaimed from error&rsquo;s ways,<br>
inspired with hope and praise,<br>
to Christ belong.</p></blockquote>
