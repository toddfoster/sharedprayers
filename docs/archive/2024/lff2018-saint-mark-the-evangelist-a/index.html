<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_ephesians-47-16_">The Second Lesson: <em>Ephesians 4:7-16</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p>But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it is said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive;<br>
he gave gifts to his people.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(When it says, ‘He ascended’, what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.) The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knitted together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.</p>

<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>

For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<h3 id="the-third-lesson-_mark-11-15_">The Third Lesson: <em>Mark 1:1-15</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;<br>
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: &lsquo;Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, &ldquo;The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, &ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.</p>
<p>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.&rdquo;</p>
