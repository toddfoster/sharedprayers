<p>The people who walked in darkness<br>
have seen a great light;</p>
<p>those who lived in a land of deep darkness&ndash;<br>
on them light has shined.</p>
<p>You have multiplied the nation,<br>

as with joy at the harvest,<br>
as people exult when dividing plunder.</p>
<p>For the yoke of their burden,<br>

the rod of their oppressor,<br>
you have broken as on the day of Midian.</p>
<p>For all the boots of the tramping warriors<br>
and all the garments rolled in blood<br>
shall be burned as fuel for the fire.</p>
<p>For a child has been born for us,<br>
a son given to us;<br>
authority rests upon his shoulders;<br>
and he is named</p>
<p>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,<br>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>His authority shall grow continually,<br>
and there shall be endless peace<br>

<p>In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>
<p>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]</p>

<p>You made us in your image, and taught us to walk in your ways. But we rebelled against you, and wandered far away; and yet, as a mother cares for her children, you would not forget us. Time and again you called us to live in the fullness of your love.</p>

<p>Glory and honor and praise to you, holy and living God. To deliver us from the power of sin and death and to reveal the riches of your grace, you looked with favor upon Mary, your willing servant, that she might conceive and bear a son, Jesus the holy child of God. Living among us, Jesus loved us. He broke bread with outcasts and sinners, healed the sick, and proclaimed good news to the poor. He yearned to draw all the world to himself yet we were heedless of his call to walk in love. Then, the time came for him to complete upon the cross the sacrifice of his life, and to be glorified by you.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, Jesus was at table with his friends. He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>As supper was ending, Jesus took the cup of wine. Again, he gave thanks to you, gave it to them, and said: “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is poured out for you and for all for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Now gathered at your table, O God of all creation, and remembering Christ, crucified and risen, who was and is and is to come, we offer to you our gifts of bread and wine, 	and ourselves, a living sacrifice. Pour out your Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Body and Blood of Christ. Breathe your Spirit over the whole earth and make us your new creation, the Body of Christ given for the world you have made.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time bring us, with blessed Thomas, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, from every tribe and language and people and nation, to feast at the banquet prepared from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Through Christ and with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to you be honor, glory, and praise, for ever and ever.</p>
