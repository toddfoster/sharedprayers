<p><em>Caeli enarrant</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *<br>
and the firmament shows his handiwork.<br>
<strong>2	One day tells its tale to another, *<br>
and one night imparts knowledge to another.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Although they have no words or language, *<br>
and their voices are not heard,<br>
<strong>4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *<br>
and their message to the ends of the world.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *<br>
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;<br>
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.<br>
<strong>6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens<br>
and runs about to the end of it again; *<br>
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The law of the LORD is perfect<br>
and revives the soul; *<br>
the testimony of the LORD is sure<br>
and gives wisdom to the innocent.<br>
<strong>8	The statutes of the LORD are just<br>
and rejoice the heart; *<br>
the commandment of the LORD is clear<br>
and gives light to the eyes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The fear of the LORD is clean<br>
and endures for ever; *<br>
the judgments of the LORD are true<br>
and righteous altogether.<br>
<strong>10	More to be desired are they than gold,<br>
more than much fine gold, *<br>
sweeter far than honey,<br>
than honey in the comb.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *<br>
and in keeping them there is great reward.<br>
<strong>12	Who can tell how often he offends? *<br>
cleanse me from my secret faults.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;<br>
let them not get dominion over me; *<br>
then shall I be whole and sound,<br>
and innocent of a great offense.<br>
<strong>14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>
be acceptable in your sight, *<br>
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>Moses said to the people of Israel, “Surely, this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away. It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?’ Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?’ No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe.”</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 15: The Song of Mary</strong> &ndash; <em>Magnificat</em> (Luke 1:46-55)</p>
<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_romans-109-18_">The Second Lesson: <em>Romans 10:9-18</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, ‘No one who believes in him will be put to shame.’ For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p>
<p>But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’ But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, ‘Lord, who has believed our message?’ So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.</p>
<p>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for<br>
‘Their voice has gone out to all the earth,<br>
and their words to the ends of the world.’</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 17: The Song of Simeon</strong> &mdash; <em>Nunc Dimittis</em>  (Luke 2:29-32)</p>
<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-third-lesson-_matthew-418-22_">The Third Lesson: <em>Matthew 4:18-22</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.</p>
<p>As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</p>
