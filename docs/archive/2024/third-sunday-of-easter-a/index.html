<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter addressed the people, “You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</p>
<p>“And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1	Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *<br>
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;<br>
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.<br>
<strong>2	&ldquo;You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *<br>
how long will you worship dumb idols<br>
and run after false gods?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *<br>
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.<br>
<strong>4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; *<br>
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Offer the appointed sacrifices *<br>
and put your trust in the LORD.<br>
<strong>6	Many are saying,<br>
&ldquo;Oh, that we might see better times!&rdquo; *<br>
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You have put gladness in my heart, *<br>
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.<br>
<strong>8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *<br>
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-1-john-31-7">The Second Lesson: <em>1 John 3:1-7</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John.</p>
<p>See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p>
<p>Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.</p>

<p>Jesus stood among the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.</p>
<p>Then he said to them, &ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
