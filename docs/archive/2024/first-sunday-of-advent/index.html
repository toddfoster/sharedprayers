<p>Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence&ndash;<br>
as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil&ndash;<br>
to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!<br>
When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.<br>
From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived,<br>
no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.<br>
You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways.<br>
But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.<br>
We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth.<br>
We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.<br>
There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you;<br>
for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.<br>
Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.<br>
Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember iniquity forever. Now consider, we are all your people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus, for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind&ndash; just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you&ndash; so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<p>Jesus said, “In those days, after that suffering,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,<br>
and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory. Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</p>
<p>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p>
<p>“But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch. Therefore, keep awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn, or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly. And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.”</p>

<p><strong>Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,<br>

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>

<p>Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.</p>
<p>Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.</p>
<h5 id="presider-5">Presider:</h5>
<p>All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.</p>
