<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Habakkuk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;<br>
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.<br>
Then the LORD answered me and said:<br>
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.<br>
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.<br>
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.<br>
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
<h3 id="psalm-126">Psalm 126</h3>
<p><em>In convertendo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *<br>
then were we like those who dream.<br>
<strong>2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *<br>
and our tongue with shouts of joy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Then they said among the nations, *<br>
&ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	The LORD has done great things for us, *<br>
and we are glad indeed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *<br>
like the watercourses of the Negev.<br>
<strong>6	Those who sowed with tears *<br>
will reap with songs of joy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *<br>
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-hebrews-1035-111">The Second Lesson: <em>Hebrews 10:35-11:1</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. For yet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in a very little while,<br>
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;<br>
but my righteous one will live by faith.<br>
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.</p>
<p>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</p>

<p>Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”</p>
<p>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”</p>

by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
