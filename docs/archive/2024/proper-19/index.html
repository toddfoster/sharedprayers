<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wisdom cries out in the street; in the squares she raises her voice.<br>
At the busiest corner she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:<br>
“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?<br>
How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?<br>
Give heed to my reproof;<br>
I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.<br>
Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,<br>
and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,<br>
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,<br>
when panic strikes you like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.<br>
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.<br>
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,<br>
would have none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof,<br>
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and be sated with their own devices.<br>
For waywardness kills the simple, and the complacency of fools destroys them;<br>
but those who listen to me will be secure and will live at ease, without dread of disaster.”</p></blockquote>

<p>1	The heavens declare the glory of / God, *<br>
and the firmament shows his / handiwork.<br>
<strong>2	One day tells its tale to an- / other, *<br>
and one night imparts knowledge to an- / other.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Although they have no words or / language, *<br>
and their voices are not / heard,<br>

<blockquote>
<p>5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the / sun; *<br>
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;<br>
it rejoices like a champion to run its / course.<br>
<strong>6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens<br>
and runs about to the end of it a- / gain; *<br>
nothing is hidden from its burning / heat.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The law of the LORD is perfect<br>
and revives the / soul; *<br>
the testimony of the LORD is sure<br>
and gives wisdom to the / innocent.<br>
<strong>8	The statutes of the LORD are just<br>
and rejoice the / heart; *<br>
the commandment of the LORD is clear<br>
and gives light to the / eyes.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	The fear of the LORD is clean<br>

cleanse me from my secret / faults.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;<br>
let them not get dominion / over me; *<br>
then shall I be whole and sound,<br>

<strong>14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>
be acceptable in your / sight, *<br>
O LORD, my strength and my re- / deemer.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-james-31-12">The Second Lesson: <em>James 3:1-12</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle of James.</p>
<p>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes. Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking is perfect, able to keep the whole body in check with a bridle. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies. Or look at ships: though they are so large that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great exploits.</p>
<p>How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell. For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue&ndash; a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water? Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh.</p>

<h3 id="sequence-hymn-god-is-love-let-heaven-adore-him-hymnal-379">Sequence Hymn: <em>God is Love, let heaven adore him</em> (Hymnal 379)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
God is Love: let heaven adore him;<br>
God is Love: let earth rejoice;<br>
let creation sing before him,<br>
and exalt him with one voice.<br>
God who laid the earth&rsquo;s foundation,<br>
God who spread the heavens above,<br>
God who breathes through all creation,<br>
God is Love, eternal Love.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
God is Love: and love enfolds us,<br>
all the world in one embrace;<br>
with unfailing grasp God holds us<br>
every child of every race.<br>
And when human hearts are breaking<br>
under sorrow&rsquo;s iron rod,<br>
then they find that selfsame aching<br>
deep within the heart of God.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
God is Love: and though with blindness<br>
sin afflicts all human life,<br>
God&rsquo;s eternal loving-kindness<br>
guides us through our earthly strife.<br>
Sin and death and hell shall never<br>
o&rsquo;er us final triumph gain;<br>
God is Love, so Love for ever<br>
o&rsquo;er the universe must reign.</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they answered him, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Messiah.” And he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.</p>
<p>Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”</p>
<p>He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
