<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_amos-81-12_">The First Lesson: <em>Amos 8:1-12</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Amos.</p>
<p>This is what the Lord GOD showed me&ndash; a basket of summer fruit. He said, &ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;A basket of summer fruit.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by.<br>
The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD;<br>
&ldquo;the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!&rdquo;<br>
Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,<br>
saying, &ldquo;When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain;<br>
and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?<br>
We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,<br>
buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat.&rdquo;<br>
The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:<br>
Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.<br>
Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it,<br>
and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?<br>
On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.<br>
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation;<br>
I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head;<br>
I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.<br>
The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land;<br>
not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.<br>
They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east;<br>
they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 15: The Song of Mary</strong> &ndash; <em>Magnificat</em> (Luke 1:46-55)</p>
<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_colossians-115-28_">The Second Lesson: <em>Colossians 1:15-28</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</p>
<p>And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him&ndash; provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.</p>
<p>I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ&rsquo;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church. I became its servant according to God&rsquo;s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 17: The Song of Simeon</strong> &mdash; <em>Nunc Dimittis</em>  (Luke 2:29-32)</p>
<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>As Jesus and his disciples went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and listened to what he was saying. But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, &ldquo;Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.&rdquo; But the Lord answered her, &ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.&rdquo;</p>
