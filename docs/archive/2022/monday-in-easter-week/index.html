<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_acts-21422b-32_">The First Lesson: <em>Acts 2:14,22b-32</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the multitude, &ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know&ndash; this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;<br>
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.<br>
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.<br>
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.</p>

<p><em>Conserva me, Domine</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>8<br>
I have set the LORD always before me; *<br>
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.<br>
<strong>9<br>
My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *<br>
my body also shall rest in hope.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10<br>
For you will not abandon me to the grave, *<br>
nor let your holy one see the Pit.<br>
<strong>11<br>
You will show me the path of life; *<br>
in your presence there is fullness of joy,<br>
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.</strong></p>

<h5 id="people-4"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus met Mary Magdalene and the other Mary and said, &ldquo;Greetings!&rdquo; And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them, &ldquo;You must say, `His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&rsquo; If this comes to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&rdquo; So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.</p>

<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-1">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>
We proclaim his resurrection,<br>
We await his coming in glory;</strong></p>
<h5 id="the-celebrant-continues-2">The Celebrant continues:</h5>
<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-3">Celebrant:</h5>
