<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>
<p>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died. For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</p>

<p>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&rsquo; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.</p>
<p>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
