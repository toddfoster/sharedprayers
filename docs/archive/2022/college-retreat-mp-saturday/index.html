<blockquote>
<p>33	The LORD changed rivers into deserts, *<br>
and water-springs into thirsty ground,<br>
<strong>34	A fruitful land into salt flats, *<br>
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>35	He changed deserts into pools of water *<br>
and dry land into water-springs.<br>
<strong>36	He settled the hungry there, *<br>
and they founded a city to dwell in.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>37	They sowed fields, and planted vineyards, *<br>
and brought in a fruitful harvest.<br>
<strong>38	He blessed them, so that they increased greatly; *<br>
he did not let their herds decrease.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>39	Yet when they were diminished and brought low, *<br>
through stress of adversity and sorrow,<br>
<strong>40	(He pours contempt on princes *<br>
and makes them wander in trackless wastes)</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>41	He lifted up the poor out of misery *<br>
and multiplied their families like flocks of sheep.<br>
<strong>42	The upright will see this and rejoice, *<br>
but all wickedness will shut its mouth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>43	Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *<br>
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.</p></blockquote>

awake, lute and harp; *<br>
I myself will waken the dawn.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	I will confess you among the peoples, O LORD; *<br>

and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Exalt yourself above the heavens, O God, *<br>
and your glory over all the earth.<br>
<strong>6	So that those who are dear to you may be delivered, *<br>

<h3 id="the-first-lesson-malachi-313-46">The First Lesson: <em>Malachi 3:13-4:6</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Malachi.</p>
<p>You have spoken harsh words against me, says the Lord. Yet you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God. What do we profit by keeping his command or by going about as mourners before the Lord of hosts? Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape.’</p>
<p>Then those who revered the Lord spoke with one another. The Lord took note and listened, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who revered the Lord and thought on his name. They shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act, and I will spare them as parents spare their children who serve them. Then once more you shall see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.</p>
<p>See, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.</p>
<p>Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse.</p>

<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt: &ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, &lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.&rsquo; But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&rsquo; I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</p>
