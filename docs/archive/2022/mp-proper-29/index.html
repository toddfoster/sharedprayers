<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.</p>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</p>

<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
