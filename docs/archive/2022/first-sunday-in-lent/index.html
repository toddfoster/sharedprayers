<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.</p>

<p>1<br>
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *<br>
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
<strong>2<br>
He shall say to the LORD,<br>
&ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *<br>
my God in whom I put my trust.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9  Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *<br>
and the Most High your habitation,<br>
<strong>10  There shall no evil happen to you, *<br>
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11  For he shall give his angels charge over you, *<br>
to keep you in all your ways.<br>
<strong>12 They shall bear you in their hands, *<br>
lest you dash your foot against a stone.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 You shall tread upon the lion and adder; *<br>
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.<br>
<strong>14 Because he is bound to me in love,<br>
therefore will I deliver him; *<br>
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *<br>
I am with him in trouble;<br>
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.<br>
<strong>16  With long life will I satisfy him, *<br>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, &ldquo;No one who believes in him will be put to shame.&rdquo; For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, &ldquo;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>After his baptism, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished. The devil said to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;One does not live by bread alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, &ldquo;To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &ldquo;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;It is said, &lsquo;Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&rsquo;&rdquo; When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
