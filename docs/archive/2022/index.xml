&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who gave such grace to your apostle Andrew that he readily obeyed the call of your Son Jesus Christ, and brought his brother with him: Give us, who are called by your Holy Word, grace to follow him without delay, and to bring those near to us into his gracious presence; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses said to the people of Israel, “Surely, this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too hard for you, nor is it too far away. It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?’ Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?’ No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caeli enarrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *&lt;br&gt;
and the firmament shows his handiwork.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	One day tells its tale to another, *&lt;br&gt;
and one night imparts knowledge to another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Although they have no words or language, *&lt;br&gt;
and their voices are not heard,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it again; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The law of the LORD is perfect&lt;br&gt;
and revives the soul; *&lt;br&gt;
the testimony of the LORD is sure&lt;br&gt;
and gives wisdom to the innocent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The statutes of the LORD are just&lt;br&gt;
and rejoice the heart; *&lt;br&gt;
the commandment of the LORD is clear&lt;br&gt;
and gives light to the eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The fear of the LORD is clean&lt;br&gt;
and endures for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
the judgments of the LORD are true&lt;br&gt;
and righteous altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he offends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great offense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-108b-18_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 10:8b-18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;canticle-4-or-16&#34;&gt;Canticle 4 or 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *&lt;br&gt;
he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight&lt;br&gt;
all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To give his people knowledge of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In the tender compassion of our God *&lt;br&gt;
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &amp;ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&amp;rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &amp;ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&amp;rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jubilate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Be joyful in the LORD, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
serve the LORD with gladness&lt;br&gt;
and come before his presence with a song.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Know this: The LORD himself is God; *&lt;br&gt;
he himself has made us, and we are his;&lt;br&gt;
we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Enter his gates with thanksgiving;&lt;br&gt;
go into his courts with praise; *&lt;br&gt;
give thanks to him and call upon his Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For the LORD is good;&lt;br&gt;
his mercy is everlasting; *&lt;br&gt;
and his faithfulness endures from age to age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the crowd found Jesus on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &amp;ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.&amp;rdquo; Then they said to him, &amp;ldquo;What must we do to perform the works of God?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&amp;rdquo; So they said to him, &amp;ldquo;What sign are you going to give us then, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Then Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, give us this bread always.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-4&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-20&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blessed Lord, who caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning: Grant us so to hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life, which you have given us in our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;&lt;br&gt;
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.&lt;br&gt;
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;&lt;br&gt;
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;&lt;br&gt;
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.&lt;br&gt;
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;&lt;br&gt;
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;&lt;br&gt;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;&lt;br&gt;
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&amp;ndash; and their descendants as well.&lt;br&gt;
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&amp;ndash; its food shall be dust!&lt;br&gt;
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;canticle-9&#34;&gt;Canticle 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely, it is God who saves me; *&lt;br&gt;
I will trust in him and not be afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will be my Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, and we did not eat anyone&amp;rsquo;s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you. This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, &lt;code&gt;I am he!&#39; and, &lt;/code&gt;The time is near!&amp;rsquo; Do not go after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, whose blessed Son came into the world that he might destroy the works of the devil and make us children of God and heirs of eternal life: Grant that, having this hope, we may purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he comes again with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his eternal and glorious kingdom; where he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Haggai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai, saying: Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say, Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing? Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts, according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear. For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts. The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exaltabo te, Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I will exalt you, O God my King, *&lt;br&gt;
and bless your Name for ever and ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Every day will I bless you *&lt;br&gt;
and praise your Name for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
there is no end to his greatness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 One generation shall praise your works to another *&lt;br&gt;
and shall declare your power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 I will ponder the glorious splendor of your majesty *&lt;br&gt;
and all your marvelous works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 The LORD is righteous in all his ways *&lt;br&gt;
and loving in all his works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 The LORD is near to those who call upon him, *&lt;br&gt;
to all who call upon him faithfully.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
he hears their cry and helps them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 The LORD preserves all those who love him, *&lt;br&gt;
but he destroys all the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let all flesh bless his holy Name for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as though from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed, the one destined for destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth. For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope, comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him a question, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&amp;rsquo;s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first married, and died childless; then the second and the third married her, and so in the same way all seven died childless. Finally the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had married her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. Indeed they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed, in the story about the bush, where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Now he is God not of the dead, but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and merciful God, it is only by your gift that your faithful people offer you true and laudable service: Grant that we may run without stumbling to obtain your heavenly promises; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Habakkuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw.&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen?&lt;br&gt;
Or cry to you &amp;ldquo;Violence!&amp;rdquo; and you will not save?&lt;br&gt;
Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble?&lt;br&gt;
Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.&lt;br&gt;
So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails.&lt;br&gt;
The wicked surround the righteous&amp;ndash; therefore judgment comes forth perverted.&lt;br&gt;
I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;&lt;br&gt;
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.&lt;br&gt;
Then the LORD answered me and said:&lt;br&gt;
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.&lt;br&gt;
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.&lt;br&gt;
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.&lt;br&gt;
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-119137-144&#34;&gt;Psalm 119:137-144&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justus es, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;137 You are righteous, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and upright are your judgments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;138 You have issued your decrees *&lt;br&gt;
with justice and in perfect faithfulness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;139 My indignation has consumed me, *&lt;br&gt;
because my enemies forget your words.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;140 Your word has been tested to the uttermost, *&lt;br&gt;
and your servant holds it dear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;141 I am small and of little account, *&lt;br&gt;
yet I do not forget your commandments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;142 Your justice is an everlasting justice *&lt;br&gt;
and your law is the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;143 Trouble and distress have come upon me, *&lt;br&gt;
yet your commandments are my delight.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;144 The righteousness of your decrees is everlasting; *&lt;br&gt;
grant me understanding, that I may live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing. Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end we always pray for you, asking that our God will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.&amp;rdquo; So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, &amp;ldquo;He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.&amp;rdquo; Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.&amp;rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &amp;ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Sing to the LORD a new song; *&lt;br&gt;
sing his praise in the congregation of the faithful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; *&lt;br&gt;
let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	Let them praise his Name in the dance; *&lt;br&gt;

and adorns the poor with victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and a two-edged sword in their hand;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	To wreak vengeance on the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and punishment on the peoples;&lt;br&gt;

and their nobles with links of iron;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	To inflict on them the judgment decreed; *&lt;br&gt;
this is glory for all his faithful people.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_ephesians-111-23_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Ephesians 1:11-23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&amp;rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Joel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the later rain, as before.&lt;br&gt;
The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.&lt;br&gt;
I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust has eaten,&lt;br&gt;
the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent against you.&lt;br&gt;
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you.&lt;br&gt;
And my people shall never again be put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is no other.&lt;br&gt;
And my people shall never again be put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh;&lt;br&gt;
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.&lt;br&gt;
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes. Then everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-65&#34;&gt;Psalm 65&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Te decet hymnus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	You are to be praised, O God, in Zion; *&lt;br&gt;
to you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	To you that hear prayer shall all flesh come, *&lt;br&gt;
because of their transgressions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Our sins are stronger than we are, *&lt;br&gt;
but you will blot them out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are they whom you choose&lt;br&gt;
and draw to your courts to dwell there! *&lt;br&gt;
they will be satisfied by the beauty of your house,&lt;br&gt;
by the holiness of your temple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Awesome things will you show us in your righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
O God of our salvation, *&lt;br&gt;
O Hope of all the ends of the earth&lt;br&gt;
and of the seas that are far away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You make fast the mountains by your power; *&lt;br&gt;
they are girded about with might.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You still the roaring of the seas, *&lt;br&gt;
the roaring of their waves,&lt;br&gt;
and the clamor of the peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Those who dwell at the ends of the earth will tremble at your marvelous signs; *&lt;br&gt;
you make the dawn and the dusk to sing for joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	You visit the earth and water it abundantly;&lt;br&gt;
you make it very plenteous; *&lt;br&gt;
the river of God is full of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	You prepare the grain, *&lt;br&gt;
for so you provide for the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	You drench the furrows and smooth out the ridges; *&lt;br&gt;
with heavy rain you soften the ground and bless its increase.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You crown the year with your goodness, *&lt;br&gt;
and your paths overflow with plenty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	May the fields of the wilderness be rich for grazing, *&lt;br&gt;
and the hills be clothed with joy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	May the meadows cover themselves with flocks,&lt;br&gt;
and the valleys cloak themselves with grain; *&lt;br&gt;
let them shout for joy and sing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them! But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt: &amp;ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, &lt;code&gt;God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.&#39; But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, &lt;/code&gt;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&amp;rsquo; I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; let the earth hear the words of my mouth.&lt;br&gt;
May my teaching drop like the rain, my speech condense like the dew;&lt;br&gt;
like gentle rain on grass, like showers on new growth.&lt;br&gt;
For I will proclaim the name of the LORD; ascribe greatness to our God!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;89	O LORD, your word is everlasting; *&lt;br&gt;
it stands firm in the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;90	Your faithfulness remains from one generation to another; *&lt;br&gt;
you established the earth, and it abides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;91	By your decree these continue to this day, *&lt;br&gt;
for all things are your servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;92	If my delight had not been in your law, *&lt;br&gt;
I should have perished in my affliction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;93	I will never forget your commandments, *&lt;br&gt;
because by them you give me life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;94	I am yours; oh, that you would save me! *&lt;br&gt;
for I study your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95	Though the wicked lie in wait for me to destroy me, *&lt;br&gt;
I will apply my mind to your decrees.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;96	I see that all things come to an end, *&lt;br&gt;
but your commandment has no bounds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Christ Jesus you Gentiles, who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, “I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you. If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world&amp;ndash; therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘Servants are not greater than their master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals. And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD. In those days they shall no longer say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children&amp;rsquo;s teeth are set on edge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt&amp;ndash; a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, &amp;ldquo;Know the LORD,&amp;rdquo; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quomodo dilexi!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;97 Oh, how I love your law! *&lt;br&gt;
all the day long it is in my mind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;98 Your commandment has made me wiser than my enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is always with me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, *&lt;br&gt;
for your decrees are my study.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;100 I am wiser than the elders, *&lt;br&gt;
because I observe your commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;101 I restrain my feet from every evil way, *&lt;br&gt;
that I may keep your word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;102 I do not shrink from your judgments, *&lt;br&gt;
because you yourself have taught me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;103 How sweet are your words to my taste! *&lt;br&gt;
they are sweeter than honey to my mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;104 Through your commandments I gain understanding; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore I hate every lying way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it, and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart. He said, &amp;ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, &lt;code&gt;Grant me justice against my opponent.&#39; For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, &lt;/code&gt;Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.&#39;&amp;rdquo; And the Lord said, &amp;ldquo;Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them? I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant, O God, that, following the example of your servant James the Just, brother of our Lord, your Church may give itself continually to prayer and to the reconciliation of all who are at variance and enmity; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the apostles and elders kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, “My brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first looked favorably on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name. This agrees with the words of the prophets, as it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘After this I will return,&lt;br&gt;
and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; from its ruins I will rebuild it, and I will set it up,&lt;br&gt;
so that all other peoples may seek the Lord&amp;ndash; even all the Gentiles over whom my name has been called.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things known from long ago.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood. For in every city, for generations past, Moses has had those who proclaim him, for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1&#34;&gt;Psalm 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beatus vir qui non abiit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
nor lingered in the way of sinners,&lt;br&gt;
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and they meditate on his law day and night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,&lt;br&gt;
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *&lt;br&gt;
everything they do shall prosper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is not so with the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the way of the wicked is doomed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-151-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 15:1-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&amp;ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&amp;ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these deeds of power? Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?” And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.” And he did not do many deeds of power there, because of their unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who inspired your servant Luke the physician to set forth in the Gospel the love and healing power of your Son: Graciously continue in your Church this love and power to heal, to the praise and glory of your Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Sirach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honor physicians for their services, for the Lord created them;&lt;br&gt;
for their gift of healing comes from the Most High, and they are rewarded by the king.&lt;br&gt;
The skill of physicians makes them distinguished, and in the presence of the great they are admired.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord created medicines out of the earth, and the sensible will not despise them.&lt;br&gt;
And he gave skill to human beings that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.&lt;br&gt;
By them the physician heals and takes away pain; the pharmacist makes a mixture from them.&lt;br&gt;
God’s works will never be finished; and from him health spreads over all the earth.&lt;br&gt;
My child, when you are ill, do not delay, but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.&lt;br&gt;
Give up your faults and direct your hands rightly, and cleanse your heart from all sin.&lt;br&gt;
Then give the physician his place, for the Lord created him; do not let him leave you, for you need him.&lt;br&gt;
There may come a time when recovery lies in the hands of physicians, for they too pray to the Lord&lt;br&gt;
that he grant them success in diagnosis and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-147&#34;&gt;Psalm 147&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laudate Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *&lt;br&gt;
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
he gathers the exiles of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He heals the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;
and binds up their wounds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He counts the number of the stars *&lt;br&gt;
and calls them all by their names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Great is our LORD and mighty in power; *&lt;br&gt;
there is no limit to his wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, *&lt;br&gt;
but casts the wicked to the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *&lt;br&gt;
make music to our God upon the harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He covers the heavens with clouds *&lt;br&gt;
and prepares rain for the earth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *&lt;br&gt;
and green plants to serve mankind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He provides food for flocks and herds *&lt;br&gt;
and for the young ravens when they cry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *&lt;br&gt;
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
in those who await his gracious favor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
praise your God, O Zion;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; *&lt;br&gt;
he has blessed your children within you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	He has established peace on your borders; *&lt;br&gt;
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	He sends out his command to the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his word runs very swiftly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	He gives snow like wool; *&lt;br&gt;
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; *&lt;br&gt;
who can stand against his cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *&lt;br&gt;
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He declares his word to Jacob, *&lt;br&gt;
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	He has not done so to any other nation; *&lt;br&gt;
to them he has not revealed his judgments.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your best to come to me soon, for Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,&lt;br&gt;
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.&lt;br&gt;
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift up your hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-661-11&#34;&gt;Psalm 66:1-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jubilate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Be joyful in God, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
sing the glory of his Name;&lt;br&gt;
sing the glory of his praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Say to God, &amp;ldquo;How awesome are your deeds! *&lt;br&gt;
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 All the earth bows down before you, *&lt;br&gt;
sings to you, sings out your Name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Come now and see the works of God, *&lt;br&gt;
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 He turned the sea into dry land,&lt;br&gt;
so that they went through the water on foot, *&lt;br&gt;
and there we rejoiced in him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 In his might he rules for ever;&lt;br&gt;
his eyes keep watch over the nations; *&lt;br&gt;
let no rebel rise up against him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Bless our God, you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
make the voice of his praise to be heard;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Who holds our souls in life, *&lt;br&gt;
and will not allow our feet to slip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For you, O God, have proved us; *&lt;br&gt;
you have tried us just as silver is tried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 You brought us into the snare; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 You let enemies ride over our heads;&lt;br&gt;
we went through fire and water; *&lt;br&gt;
but you brought us out into a place of refreshment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-timothy-28-15_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Timothy 2:8-15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David&amp;ndash; that is my gospel, for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. The saying is sure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful&amp;ndash; for he cannot deny himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee. As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance, they called out, saying, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&amp;rdquo; When he saw them, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests.&amp;rdquo; And as they went, they were made clean. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, &amp;ldquo;Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?&amp;rdquo; Then he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Lamentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How lonely sits the city that once was full of people!&lt;br&gt;
How like a widow she has become, she that was great among the nations!&lt;br&gt;
She that was a princess among the provinces has become a vassal.&lt;br&gt;
She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks;&lt;br&gt;
among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her;&lt;br&gt;
all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;
Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude;&lt;br&gt;
she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place;&lt;br&gt;
her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress.&lt;br&gt;
The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals;&lt;br&gt;
all her gates are desolate, her priests groan;&lt;br&gt;
her young girls grieve, and her lot is bitter.&lt;br&gt;
Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper,&lt;br&gt;
because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions;&lt;br&gt;
her children have gone away, captives before the foe.&lt;br&gt;
From daughter Zion has departed all her majesty.&lt;br&gt;
Her princes have become like stags that find no pasture;&lt;br&gt;
they fled without strength before the pursuer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lamentations-319-26&#34;&gt;Lamentations 3:19-26&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of my affliction and my homelessness is wormwood and gall!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The LORD is my portion,&amp;rdquo; says my soul, &amp;ldquo;therefore I will hope in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-timothy-11-14_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Timothy 1:1-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, for the sake of the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Timothy, my beloved child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to God&amp;ndash; whom I worship with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did&amp;ndash; when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God, who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher, and for this reason I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that day what I have entrusted to him. Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Guard the good treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit living in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostles said to the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Increase our faith!&amp;rdquo; The Lord replied, &amp;ldquo;If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, `Be uprooted and planted in the sea,&amp;rsquo; and it would obey you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who among you would say to your slave who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, &lt;code&gt;Come here at once and take your place at the table&#39;? Would you not rather say to him, &lt;/code&gt;Prepare supper for me, put on your apron and serve me while I eat and drink; later you may eat and drink&amp;rsquo;? Do you thank the slave for doing what was commanded? So you also, when you have done all that you were ordered to do, say, `We are worthless slaves; we have done only what we ought to have done!&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah, where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me: Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, &amp;ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.&amp;rdquo; Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, &amp;ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.&amp;rdquo; Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy; and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. In their presence I charged Baruch, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *&lt;br&gt;
I am with him in trouble;&lt;br&gt;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is great gain in godliness combined with contentment; for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it; but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will bring about at the right time&amp;ndash; he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords. It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&amp;rsquo;s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores. The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, &lt;code&gt;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.&#39; But Abraham said, &lt;/code&gt;Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.&amp;rsquo; He said, &lt;code&gt;Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father&#39;s house-- for I have five brothers-- that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.&#39; Abraham replied, &lt;/code&gt;They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.&amp;rsquo; He said, &lt;code&gt;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&#39; He said to him, &lt;/code&gt;If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everlasting God, you have ordained and constituted in a wonderful order the ministries of angels and mortals: Mercifully grant that, as your holy angels always serve and worship you in heaven, so by your appointment they may help and defend us here on earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-103&#34;&gt;Psalm 103&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedic, anima mea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *&lt;br&gt;
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *&lt;br&gt;
and forget not all his benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He forgives all your sins *&lt;br&gt;
and heals all your infirmities;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He redeems your life from the grave *&lt;br&gt;
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He satisfies you with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and your youth is renewed like an eagle&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The LORD executes righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and judgment for all who are oppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He made his ways known to Moses *&lt;br&gt;
and his works to the children of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *&lt;br&gt;
slow to anger and of great kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He will not always accuse us, *&lt;br&gt;
nor will he keep his anger for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *&lt;br&gt;
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	As far as the east is from the west, *&lt;br&gt;
so far has he removed our sins from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	As a father cares for his children, *&lt;br&gt;
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *&lt;br&gt;
he remembers that we are but dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Our days are like the grass; *&lt;br&gt;
we flourish like a flower of the field;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *&lt;br&gt;
and its place shall know it no more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever&lt;br&gt;
on those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and his righteousness on children&amp;rsquo;s children;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	On those who keep his covenant *&lt;br&gt;
and remember his commandments and do them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *&lt;br&gt;
and his kingship has dominion over all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,&lt;br&gt;
you mighty ones who do his bidding, *&lt;br&gt;
and hearken to the voice of his word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
you ministers of his who do his will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,&lt;br&gt;
in all places of his dominion; *&lt;br&gt;
bless the LORD, O my soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_revelation-127-12_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Revelation 12:7-12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah,&lt;br&gt;
for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.&lt;br&gt;
But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,&lt;br&gt;
for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them!&lt;br&gt;
But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you&lt;br&gt;
with great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My joy is gone, grief is upon me, my heart is sick.&lt;br&gt;
Hark, the cry of my poor people from far and wide in the land:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
(&amp;ldquo;Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, with their foreign idols?&amp;quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
For the hurt of my poor people I am hurt, I mourn, and dismay has taken hold of me.&lt;br&gt;
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?&lt;br&gt;
Why then has the health of my poor people not been restored?&lt;br&gt;
O that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears,&lt;br&gt;
so that I might weep day and night for the slain of my poor people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance;&lt;br&gt;
they have profaned your holy temple; *&lt;br&gt;
they have made Jerusalem a heap of rubble.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the air, *&lt;br&gt;
and the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 They have shed their blood like water on every side of Jerusalem, *&lt;br&gt;
and there was no one to bury them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, *&lt;br&gt;
an object of scorn and derision to those around us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 How long will you be angry, O LORD? *&lt;br&gt;
will your fury blaze like fire for ever?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not known you *&lt;br&gt;
and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 For they have devoured Jacob *&lt;br&gt;
and made his dwelling a ruin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Remember not our past sins;&lt;br&gt;
let your compassion be swift to meet us; *&lt;br&gt;
for we have been brought very low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your Name; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver us and forgive us our sins, for your Name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-timothy-21-7_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Timothy 2:1-7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and humankind,&lt;br&gt;
Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; this was attested at the right time. For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. So he summoned him and said to him, &lt;code&gt;What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.&#39; Then the manager said to himself, &lt;/code&gt;What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.&amp;rsquo; So, summoning his master&amp;rsquo;s debtors one by one, he asked the first, &lt;code&gt;How much do you owe my master?&#39; He answered, &lt;/code&gt;A hundred jugs of olive oil.&amp;rsquo; He said to him, &lt;code&gt;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.&#39; Then he asked another, &lt;/code&gt;And how much do you owe?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &lt;code&gt;A hundred containers of wheat.&#39; He said to him, &lt;/code&gt;Take your bill and make it eighty.&amp;rsquo; And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My child, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;&lt;br&gt;
for length of days and years of life and abundant welfare they will give you.&lt;br&gt;
Do not let loyalty and faithfulness forsake you; bind them round your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.&lt;br&gt;
So you will find favour and good repute in the sight of God and of people.&lt;br&gt;
Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight.&lt;br&gt;
In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.&lt;/p&gt;

I shall keep it with all my heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35 Make me go in the path of your commandments, *&lt;br&gt;
for that is my desire.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;36 Incline my heart to your decrees *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it, and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”&lt;/p&gt;

by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A hot wind comes from me out of the bare heights in the desert toward my poor people, not to winnow or cleanse&amp;ndash; a wind too strong for that. Now it is I who speak in judgment against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For my people are foolish, they do not know me;&lt;br&gt;
they are stupid children, they have no understanding.&lt;br&gt;
They are skilled in doing evil, but do not know how to do good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.&lt;br&gt;
I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.&lt;br&gt;
I looked, and lo, there was no one at all, and all the birds of the air had fled.&lt;br&gt;
I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thus says the LORD: The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above grow black;&lt;br&gt;
for I have spoken, I have purposed; I have not relented nor will I turn back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-14&#34;&gt;Psalm 14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixit insipiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The fool has said in his heart, &amp;ldquo;There is no God.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;&lt;br&gt;
there is none who does any good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD looks down from heaven upon us all, *&lt;br&gt;
to see if there is any who is wise,&lt;br&gt;
if there is one who seeks after God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Every one has proved faithless;&lt;br&gt;
all alike have turned bad; *&lt;br&gt;
there is none who does good; no, not one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers *&lt;br&gt;
who eat up my people like bread&lt;br&gt;
and do not call upon the LORD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	See how they tremble with fear, *&lt;br&gt;
because God is in the company of the righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, *&lt;br&gt;
but the LORD is their refuge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Oh, that Israel&amp;rsquo;s deliverance would come out of Zion! *&lt;br&gt;
when the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,&lt;br&gt;
Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-timothy-112-17_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Timothy 1:12-17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service, even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a man of violence. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&amp;ndash; of whom I am the foremost. But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience, making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to Jesus. And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, &amp;ldquo;This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he told them this parable: &amp;ldquo;Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, `Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.&amp;rsquo; Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, `Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.&amp;rsquo; Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together!&lt;br&gt;
Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old?&lt;br&gt;
Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other god besides me,&lt;br&gt;
a righteous God and a Saviour; there is no one besides me.&lt;br&gt;
Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other.&lt;br&gt;
By myself I have sworn, from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness a word that shall not return:&lt;br&gt;
“To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.”&lt;br&gt;
Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength;&lt;br&gt;
all who were incensed against him shall come to him and be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
In the LORD all the offspring of Israel shall triumph and glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cantate Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Sing to the LORD a new song, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has done marvelous things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	With his right hand and his holy arm *&lt;br&gt;
has he won for himself the victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	The LORD has made known his victory; *&lt;br&gt;
his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Shout with joy to the LORD, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
lift up your voice, rejoice, and sing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Sing to the LORD with the harp, *&lt;br&gt;
with the harp and the voice of song.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	With trumpets and the sound of the horn *&lt;br&gt;
shout with joy before the King, the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Let the sea make a noise and all that is in it, *&lt;br&gt;
the lands and those who dwell therein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Let the rivers clap their hands, *&lt;br&gt;
and let the hills ring out with joy before the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	In righteousness shall he judge the world *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with equity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: &amp;ldquo;Come, go down to the potter&amp;rsquo;s house, and there I will let you hear my words.&amp;rdquo; So I went down to the potter&amp;rsquo;s house, and there he was working at his wheel. The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&amp;rsquo;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to me: Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the LORD. Just like the clay in the potter&amp;rsquo;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1391-512-17&#34;&gt;Psalm 139:1-5,12-17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, probasti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You press upon me behind and before *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand upon me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 For you yourself created my inmost parts; *&lt;br&gt;
you knit me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *&lt;br&gt;
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 My body was not hidden from you, *&lt;br&gt;
while I was being made in secret&lt;br&gt;
and woven in the depths of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;&lt;br&gt;
all of them were written in your book; *&lt;br&gt;
they were fashioned day by day,&lt;br&gt;
when as yet there was none of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
how great is the sum of them!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *&lt;br&gt;
to count them all, my life span would need to be like yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_philemon-1-21_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Philemon 1-21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to Philemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus. I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ. I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty, yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love&amp;ndash; and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother&amp;ndash; especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus; and he turned and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, `This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.&amp;rsquo; Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. Thus says the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me,&lt;br&gt;
and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?&lt;br&gt;
They did not say, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt,&lt;br&gt;
who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits,&lt;br&gt;
in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I brought you into a plentiful land to eat its fruits and its good things.&lt;br&gt;
But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.&lt;br&gt;
The priests did not say, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD?&amp;rdquo; Those who handle the law did not know me;&lt;br&gt;
the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore once more I accuse you, says the LORD, and I accuse your children&amp;rsquo;s children.&lt;br&gt;
Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing.&lt;br&gt;
Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods?&lt;br&gt;
But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit.&lt;br&gt;
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate,&lt;br&gt;
says the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me,&lt;br&gt;
the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves,&lt;br&gt;
cracked cisterns that can hold no water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-81110-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 81:1,10-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exultate Deo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Sing with joy to God our strength *&lt;br&gt;
and raise a loud shout to the God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 I am the LORD your God,&lt;br&gt;
who brought you out of the land of Egypt and said, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 And yet my people did not hear my voice, *&lt;br&gt;
and Israel would not obey me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their hearts, *&lt;br&gt;
to follow their own devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Oh, that my people would listen to me! *&lt;br&gt;
that Israel would walk in my ways!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 I should soon subdue their enemies *&lt;br&gt;
and turn my hand against their foes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and their punishment would last for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 But Israel would I feed with the finest wheat *&lt;br&gt;
and satisfy him with honey from the rock.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-131-815-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 13:1-8,15-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured. Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, &amp;ldquo;I will never leave you or forsake you.&amp;rdquo; So we can say with confidence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.&lt;br&gt;
What can anyone do to me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember your leaders, those who spoke the word of God to you; consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through him, then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were watching him closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. &amp;ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, &lt;code&gt;Give this person your place,&#39; and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, &lt;/code&gt;Friend, move up higher&amp;rsquo;; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said also to the one who had invited him, &amp;ldquo;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to me saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.&amp;rdquo; But the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not say, &amp;lsquo;I am only a boy&amp;rsquo;; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you, Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; *&lt;br&gt;
let me never be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my crag and my stronghold.&lt;br&gt;

Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For you are my hope, O Lord GOD, *&lt;br&gt;
my confidence since I was young.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;&lt;br&gt;
from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *&lt;br&gt;
my praise shall be always of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them. (For they could not endure the order that was given, &amp;ldquo;If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.&amp;rdquo; Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, &amp;ldquo;I tremble with fear.&amp;quot;) But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven! At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, &amp;ldquo;Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.&amp;rdquo; This phrase, &amp;ldquo;Yet once more,&amp;rdquo; indicates the removal of what is shaken&amp;ndash; that is, created things&amp;ndash; so that what cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe; for indeed our God is a consuming fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years. She was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight. When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, &amp;ldquo;Woman, you are set free from your ailment.&amp;rdquo; When he laid his hands on her, immediately she stood up straight and began praising God. But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had cured on the sabbath, kept saying to the crowd, &amp;ldquo;There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be cured, and not on the sabbath day.&amp;rdquo; But the Lord answered him and said, &amp;ldquo;You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger, and lead it away to give it water? And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?&amp;rdquo; When he said this, all his opponents were put to shame; and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall heed such a prophet. This is what you requested of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said: “If I hear the voice of the LORD my God any more, or ever again see this great fire, I will die.” Then the LORD replied to me: “They are right in what they have said. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will put my words in the mouth of the prophet, who shall speak to them everything that I command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qui habitat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He shall say to the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *&lt;br&gt;
my God in whom I put my trust.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *&lt;br&gt;
and from the deadly pestilence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He shall cover you with his pinions,&lt;br&gt;
and you shall find refuge under his wings; *&lt;br&gt;
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *&lt;br&gt;
nor of the arrow that flies by day;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, *&lt;br&gt;
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	A thousand shall fall at your side&lt;br&gt;
and ten thousand at your right hand, *&lt;br&gt;
but it shall not come near you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Your eyes have only to behold *&lt;br&gt;
to see the reward of the wicked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *&lt;br&gt;
and the Most High your habitation,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	There shall no evil happen to you, *&lt;br&gt;
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, *&lt;br&gt;
to keep you in all your ways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	They shall bear you in their hands, *&lt;br&gt;
lest you dash your foot against a stone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *&lt;br&gt;
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Because he is bound to me in love,&lt;br&gt;
therefore will I deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *&lt;br&gt;
I am with him in trouble;&lt;br&gt;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	With long life will I satisfy him, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute arose among the disciples as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me sing for my beloved my love-song concerning his vineyard:&lt;br&gt;
My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.&lt;br&gt;
He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines;&lt;br&gt;
he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it;&lt;br&gt;
he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.&lt;br&gt;
And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah,&lt;br&gt;
judge between me and my vineyard.&lt;br&gt;
What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?&lt;br&gt;
When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?&lt;br&gt;
And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.&lt;br&gt;
I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured;&lt;br&gt;
I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.&lt;br&gt;
I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns;&lt;br&gt;
I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.&lt;br&gt;
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,&lt;br&gt;
and the people of Judah are his pleasant planting;&lt;br&gt;
he expected justice, but saw bloodshed;&lt;br&gt;
righteousness, but heard a cry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-801-28-18&#34;&gt;Psalm 80:1-2,8-18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qui regis Israel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; *&lt;br&gt;
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, *&lt;br&gt;
stir up your strength and come to help us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt; *&lt;br&gt;
you cast out the nations and planted it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9 You prepared the ground for it; *&lt;br&gt;
it took root and filled the land.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 The mountains were covered by its shadow *&lt;br&gt;
and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11 You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea *&lt;br&gt;
and its branches to the River.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Why have you broken down its wall, *&lt;br&gt;
so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, *&lt;br&gt;
and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven;&lt;br&gt;
behold and tend this vine; *&lt;br&gt;
preserve what your right hand has planted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 They burn it with fire like rubbish; *&lt;br&gt;
at the rebuke of your countenance let them perish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man you have made so strong for yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 And so will we never turn away from you; *&lt;br&gt;
give us life, that we may call upon your Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; *&lt;br&gt;
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned. By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days. By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets&amp;ndash; who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented&amp;ndash; of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from us, be made perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and what stress I am under until it is completed! Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three; they will be divided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;father against son and son against father,&lt;br&gt;
mother against daughter and daughter against mother,&lt;br&gt;
mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said to the crowds, &amp;ldquo;When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, &lt;code&gt;It is going to rain&#39;; and so it happens. And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, &lt;/code&gt;There will be scorching heat&amp;rsquo;; and it happens. You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, you have taken to yourself the blessed Virgin Mary, mother of your incarnate Son: Grant that we, who have been redeemed by his blood, may share with her the glory of your eternal kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&lt;br&gt;
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-34&#34;&gt;Psalm 34&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedicam Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will bless the LORD at all times; *&lt;br&gt;
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	I will glory in the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let the humble hear and rejoice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let us exalt his Name together.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I sought the LORD, and he answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and delivered me out of all my terror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Look upon him and be radiant, *&lt;br&gt;
and let not your faces be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *&lt;br&gt;
and saved me from all my troubles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will deliver them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Taste and see that the LORD is good; *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who trust in him!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Fear the LORD, you that are his saints, *&lt;br&gt;
for those who fear him lack nothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The young lions lack and suffer hunger, *&lt;br&gt;
but those who seek the LORD lack nothing that is good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Come, children, and listen to me; *&lt;br&gt;
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who among you loves life *&lt;br&gt;
and desires long life to enjoy prosperity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Keep your tongue from evil-speaking *&lt;br&gt;
and your lips from lying words.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Turn from evil and do good; *&lt;br&gt;
seek peace and pursue it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
and his ears are open to their cry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, *&lt;br&gt;
to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	The righteous cry, and the LORD hears them *&lt;br&gt;
and delivers them from all their troubles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	The LORD is near to the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;
and will save those whose spirits are crushed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Many are the troubles of the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the LORD will deliver him out of them all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He will keep safe all his bones; *&lt;br&gt;
not one of them shall be broken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Evil shall slay the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	The LORD ransoms the life of his servants, *&lt;br&gt;
and none will be punished who trust in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;br&gt;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;br&gt;
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&lt;br&gt;
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&lt;br&gt;
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&lt;br&gt;
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom!&lt;br&gt;
Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!&lt;br&gt;
What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord;&lt;br&gt;
I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts;&lt;br&gt;
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.&lt;br&gt;
When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;&lt;br&gt;
bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me.&lt;br&gt;
New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation&amp;ndash; I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.&lt;br&gt;
Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;&lt;br&gt;
they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.&lt;br&gt;
When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;&lt;br&gt;
even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.&lt;br&gt;
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes;&lt;br&gt;
cease to do evil, learn to do good;&lt;br&gt;
seek justice, rescue the oppressed,&lt;br&gt;
defend the orphan, plead for the widow.&lt;br&gt;
Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow;&lt;br&gt;
though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.&lt;br&gt;
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;&lt;br&gt;
but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-501-823-24&#34;&gt;Psalm 50:1-8,23-24&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus deorum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 The LORD, the God of gods, has spoken; *&lt;br&gt;
he has called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Out of Zion, perfect in its beauty, *&lt;br&gt;
God reveals himself in glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Our God will come and will not keep silence; *&lt;br&gt;
before him there is a consuming flame,&lt;br&gt;
and round about him a raging storm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 He calls the heavens and the earth from above *&lt;br&gt;
to witness the judgment of his people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 &amp;ldquo;Gather before me my loyal followers, *&lt;br&gt;
those who have made a covenant with me&lt;br&gt;
and sealed it with sacrifice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Let the heavens declare the rightness of his cause; *&lt;br&gt;
for God himself is judge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;O Israel, I will bear witness against you; *&lt;br&gt;
for I am God, your God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I do not accuse you because of your sacrifices; *&lt;br&gt;
your offerings are always before me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 Consider this well, you who forget God, *&lt;br&gt;
lest I rend you and there be none to deliver you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24 Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me; *&lt;br&gt;
but to those who keep in my way will I show the salvation of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-111-38-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 11:1-3,8-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&amp;ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&amp;ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, &amp;ldquo;as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father&amp;rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them. If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Hosea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&lt;br&gt;
The more I called them, the more they went from me;&lt;br&gt;
they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them.&lt;br&gt;
I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love.&lt;br&gt;
I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.&lt;br&gt;
They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.&lt;br&gt;
The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes.&lt;br&gt;
My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all.&lt;br&gt;
How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel?&lt;br&gt;
How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim?&lt;br&gt;
My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender.&lt;br&gt;
I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim;&lt;br&gt;
for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.&lt;br&gt;
They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion;&lt;br&gt;
when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.&lt;br&gt;
They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1071-943&#34;&gt;Psalm 107:1-9,43&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confitemini Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, *&lt;br&gt;
and his mercy endures for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let all those whom the LORD has redeemed proclaim *&lt;br&gt;
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 He gathered them out of the lands; *&lt;br&gt;
from the east and from the west,&lt;br&gt;
from the north and from the south.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Some wandered in desert wastes; *&lt;br&gt;
they found no way to a city where they might dwell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 They were hungry and thirsty; *&lt;br&gt;
their spirits languished within them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, *&lt;br&gt;
and he delivered them from their distress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He put their feet on a straight path *&lt;br&gt;
to go to a city where they might dwell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy *&lt;br&gt;
and the wonders he does for his children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For he satisfies the thirsty *&lt;br&gt;
and fills the hungry with good things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;43 Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *&lt;br&gt;
and consider well the mercies of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_colossians-31-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Colossians 3:1-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life. But now you must get rid of all such things&amp;ndash; anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator. In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.&amp;rdquo; But he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?&amp;rdquo; And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one&amp;rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&amp;rdquo; Then he told them a parable: &amp;ldquo;The land of a rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, &lt;code&gt;What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?&#39; Then he said, &lt;/code&gt;I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, &lt;code&gt;Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.&#39; But God said to him, &lt;/code&gt;You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?&amp;rsquo; So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;

he is the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,&lt;br&gt;
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *&lt;br&gt;
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; *&lt;br&gt;
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;O LORD our God, you answered them indeed; *&lt;br&gt;
you were a God who forgave them,&lt;br&gt;
yet punished them for their evil deeds.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God&lt;br&gt;
and worship him upon his holy hill; *&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD our God is the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-peter-113-21_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Peter 1:13-21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory, since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one&amp;rsquo;s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” —not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Hosea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, &amp;ldquo;Go, take for yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD.&amp;rdquo; So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them. But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by horses, or by horsemen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said, &amp;ldquo;Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, &amp;ldquo;You are not my people,&amp;rdquo; it shall be said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children of the living God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	You have been gracious to your land, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *&lt;br&gt;
and blotted out all their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have withdrawn all your fury *&lt;br&gt;
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
let your anger depart from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? *&lt;br&gt;
will you prolong your anger from age to age?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Will you not give us life again, *&lt;br&gt;
that your people may rejoice in you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and grant us your salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, *&lt;br&gt;
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people&lt;br&gt;
and to those who turn their hearts to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
that his glory may dwell in our land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Mercy and truth have met together; *&lt;br&gt;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, *&lt;br&gt;
and our land will yield its increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Righteousness shall go before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths. These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was praying in a certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;When you pray, say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, &lt;code&gt;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.&#39; And he answers from within, &lt;/code&gt;Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.&amp;rsquo; I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O gracious God, we remember before you today your servant and apostle James, first among the Twelve to suffer martyrdom for the Name of Jesus Christ; and we pray that you will pour out upon the leaders of your Church that spirit of self-denying service by which alone they may have true authority among your people; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: You said, “Woe is me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.” Thus you shall say to him, “Thus says the LORD: I am going to break down what I have built, and pluck up what I have planted—that is, the whole land. And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am going to bring disaster upon all flesh, says the LORD; but I will give you your life as a prize of war in every place to which you may go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-71-10&#34;&gt;Psalm 7:1-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, Deus meus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; *&lt;br&gt;
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *&lt;br&gt;
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 O LORD my God, if I have done these things: *&lt;br&gt;
if there is any wickedness in my hands,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 If I have repaid my friend with evil, *&lt;br&gt;
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *&lt;br&gt;
trample my life into the ground,&lt;br&gt;
and lay my honor in the dust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; *&lt;br&gt;
rise up against the fury of my enemies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Awake, O my God, decree justice; *&lt;br&gt;
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, judge the nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Give judgment for me according to my righteousness, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and according to my innocence, O Most High.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,&lt;br&gt;
but establish the righteous; *&lt;br&gt;
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword. After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling before him, she asked a favor of him. And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Declare that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers. But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave; just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Amos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Lord GOD showed me&amp;ndash; a basket of summer fruit. He said, &amp;ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&amp;rdquo; And I said, &amp;ldquo;A basket of summer fruit.&amp;rdquo; Then the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by.&lt;br&gt;
The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,&amp;rdquo; says the Lord GOD;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,&lt;br&gt;
saying, &amp;ldquo;When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain;&lt;br&gt;
and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?&lt;br&gt;
We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,&lt;br&gt;
buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:&lt;br&gt;
Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.&lt;br&gt;
Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?&lt;br&gt;
On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.&lt;br&gt;
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation;&lt;br&gt;
I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head;&lt;br&gt;
I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.&lt;br&gt;
The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land;&lt;br&gt;
not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east;&lt;br&gt;
they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-52&#34;&gt;Psalm 52&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quid gloriaris?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	You tyrant, why do you boast of wickedness *&lt;br&gt;
against the godly all day long?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You plot ruin;&lt;br&gt;
your tongue is like a sharpened razor, *&lt;br&gt;
O worker of deception.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You love evil more than good *&lt;br&gt;
and lying more than speaking the truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	You love all words that hurt, *&lt;br&gt;
O you deceitful tongue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Oh, that God would demolish you utterly, *&lt;br&gt;
topple you, and snatch you from your dwelling,&lt;br&gt;
and root you out of the land of the living!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The righteous shall see and tremble, *&lt;br&gt;
and they shall laugh at him, saying,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	&amp;ldquo;This is the one who did not take God for a refuge, *&lt;br&gt;
but trusted in great wealth&lt;br&gt;
and relied upon wickedness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; *&lt;br&gt;
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	I will give you thanks for what you have done *&lt;br&gt;
and declare the goodness of your Name in the presence of the godly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_colossians-115-28_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Colossians 1:15-28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him&amp;ndash; provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ&amp;rsquo;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church. I became its servant according to God&amp;rsquo;s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jesus and his disciples went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord&amp;rsquo;s feet and listened to what he was saying. But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.&amp;rdquo; But the Lord answered her, &amp;ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, whose blessed Son restored Mary Magdalene to health of body and of mind, and called her to be a witness of his resurrection: Mercifully grant that by your grace we may be healed from all our infirmities and know you in the power of his unending life; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Judith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judith prostrated herself, put ashes on her head, and uncovered the sackcloth she was wearing. At the very time when the evening incense was being offered in the house of God in Jerusalem, Judith cried out to the Lord with a loud voice, and said, “Your strength does not depend on numbers, nor your might on the powerful. But you are the God of the lowly, helper of the oppressed, upholder of the weak, protector of the forsaken, savior of those without hope. Please, please, God of my father, God of the heritage of Israel, Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of the waters, King of all your creation, hear my prayer! Make my deceitful words bring wound and bruise on those who have planned cruel things against your covenant, and against your sacred house, and against Mount Zion, and against the house your children possess. Let your whole nation and every tribe know and understand that you are God, the God of all power and might, and that there is no other who protects the people of Israel but you alone!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-421-7&#34;&gt;Psalm 42:1-7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quemadmodum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, *&lt;br&gt;
so longs my soul for you, O God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; *&lt;br&gt;
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	My tears have been my food day and night, *&lt;br&gt;
while all day long they say to me,&lt;br&gt;
Where now is your God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; *&lt;br&gt;
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *&lt;br&gt;
among those who keep holy-day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *&lt;br&gt;
and why are you so disquieted within me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Put your trust in God; *&lt;br&gt;
for I will yet give thanks to him,&lt;br&gt;
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-corinthians-514-18_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Corinthians 5:14-18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. And the LORD said to me, &amp;ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&amp;rdquo; And I said, &amp;ldquo;A plumb line.&amp;rdquo; Then the Lord said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass them by;&lt;br&gt;
the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying, &amp;ldquo;Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. For thus Amos has said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Amaziah said to Amos, &amp;ldquo;O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there; but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king&amp;rsquo;s sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Amos answered Amaziah, &amp;ldquo;I am no prophet, nor a prophet&amp;rsquo;s son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now therefore hear the word of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
You say, &lt;code&gt;Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.&#39;  Therefore thus says the LORD:&lt;/code&gt;Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line;&lt;br&gt;
you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	God takes his stand in the council of heaven; *&lt;br&gt;
he gives judgment in the midst of the gods:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	&amp;ldquo;How long will you judge unjustly, *&lt;br&gt;
and show favor to the wicked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

defend the humble and needy;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Rescue the weak and the poor; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver them from the power of the wicked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They do not know, neither do they understand;&lt;br&gt;
they go about in darkness; *&lt;br&gt;
all the foundations of the earth are shaken.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;You are gods, *&lt;br&gt;
and all of you children of the Most High;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Nevertheless, you shall die like mortals, *&lt;br&gt;
and fall like any prince.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Arise, O God, and rule the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
for you shall take all nations for your own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God. This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf, and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God&amp;rsquo;s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God. May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. &amp;ldquo;Teacher,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;What is written in the law? What do you read there?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;And who is my neighbor?&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, `Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.&amp;rsquo; Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;The one who showed him mercy.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go and do likewise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from leprosy. Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman&amp;rsquo;s wife. She said to her mistress, &amp;ldquo;If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.&amp;rdquo; So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said. And the king of Aram said, &amp;ldquo;Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments. He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, &amp;ldquo;When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy.&amp;rdquo; When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, &amp;ldquo;Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, &amp;ldquo;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel.&amp;rdquo; So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the entrance of Elisha&amp;rsquo;s house. Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.&amp;rdquo; But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, &amp;ldquo;I thought that for me he would surely come out, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and would wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy! Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?&amp;rdquo; He turned and went away in a rage. But his servants approached and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, `Wash, and be clean&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-30&#34;&gt;Psalm 30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exaltabo te, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will exalt you, O LORD,&lt;br&gt;
because you have lifted me up *&lt;br&gt;
and have not let my enemies triumph over me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *&lt;br&gt;
and you restored me to health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *&lt;br&gt;
you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *&lt;br&gt;
give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *&lt;br&gt;
his favor for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Weeping may spend the night, *&lt;br&gt;
but joy comes in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	While I felt secure, I said,&lt;br&gt;
I shall never be disturbed. *&lt;br&gt;
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as&lt;br&gt;
the mountains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Then you hid your face, *&lt;br&gt;
and I was filled with fear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	I cried to you, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
I pleaded with the Lord, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	&amp;ldquo;What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *&lt;br&gt;
will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, be my helper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You have turned my wailing into dancing; *&lt;br&gt;
you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_galatians-61-67-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Galatians 6:(1-6),7-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted. Bear one another&amp;rsquo;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. For if those who are nothing think they are something, they deceive themselves. All must test their own work; then that work, rather than their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s work, will become a cause for pride. For all must carry their own loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow. If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit. So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest-time, if we do not give up. So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand! It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised&amp;ndash; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh. May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything! As for those who will follow this rule&amp;ndash; peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, &lt;code&gt;Peace to this house!&#39; And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person; but if not, it will return to you. Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the sick who are there, and say to them, &lt;/code&gt;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&amp;rsquo; But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, `Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventy returned with joy, saying, &amp;ldquo;Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who is not partial and takes no bribe, who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and who loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing. You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You shall fear the LORD your God; him alone you shall worship; to him you shall hold fast, and by his name you shall swear. He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exaltabo te, Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will exalt you, O God my King, *&lt;br&gt;
and bless your Name for ever and ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Every day will I bless you *&lt;br&gt;
and praise your Name for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
there is no end to his greatness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	One generation shall praise your works to another *&lt;br&gt;
and shall declare your power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	I will ponder the glorious splendor of your majesty *&lt;br&gt;
and all your marvelous works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They shall speak of the might of your wondrous acts, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will tell of your greatness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	They shall publish the remembrance of your great goodness; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall sing of your righteous deeds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, *&lt;br&gt;
slow to anger and of great kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The LORD is loving to everyone *&lt;br&gt;
and his compassion is over all his works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	All your works praise you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and your faithful servants bless you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	They make known the glory of your kingdom *&lt;br&gt;
and speak of your power;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	That the peoples may know of your power *&lt;br&gt;
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; *&lt;br&gt;
your dominion endures throughout all ages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	The LORD is faithful in all his words *&lt;br&gt;
and merciful in all his deeds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	The LORD upholds all those who fall; *&lt;br&gt;
he lifts up those who are bowed down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	The eyes of all wait upon you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and you give them their food in due season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	You open wide your hand *&lt;br&gt;
and satisfy the needs of every living creature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	The LORD is righteous in all his ways *&lt;br&gt;
and loving in all his works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	The LORD is near to those who call upon him, *&lt;br&gt;
to all who call upon him faithfully.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
he hears their cry and helps them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	The LORD preserves all those who love him, *&lt;br&gt;
but he destroys all the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
let all flesh bless his holy Name for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-118-16_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 11:8-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&amp;ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&amp;ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, “as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, &amp;ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.&amp;rdquo; But Elisha said, &amp;ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&amp;rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Elijah said to him, &amp;ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.&amp;rdquo; But he said, &amp;ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&amp;rdquo; So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &amp;ldquo;Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.&amp;rdquo; Elisha said, &amp;ldquo;Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.&amp;rdquo; He responded, &amp;ldquo;You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.&amp;rdquo; As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, &amp;ldquo;Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&amp;rdquo; But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&amp;rdquo; When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-771-211-20&#34;&gt;Psalm 77:1-2,11-20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voce mea ad Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I will cry aloud to God; *&lt;br&gt;
I will cry aloud, and he will hear me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; *&lt;br&gt;
my hands were stretched out by night and did not tire;&lt;br&gt;
I refused to be comforted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I will remember the works of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and call to mind your wonders of old time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I will meditate on all your acts *&lt;br&gt;
and ponder your mighty deeds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Your way, O God, is holy; *&lt;br&gt;
who is so great a god as our God?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 You are the God who works wonders *&lt;br&gt;
and have declared your power among the peoples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 By your strength you have redeemed your people, *&lt;br&gt;
the children of Jacob and Joseph.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 The waters saw you, O God;&lt;br&gt;
the waters saw you and trembled; *&lt;br&gt;
the very depths were shaken.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 The clouds poured out water;&lt;br&gt;
the skies thundered; *&lt;br&gt;
your arrows flashed to and fro;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind;&lt;br&gt;
your lightnings lit up the world; *&lt;br&gt;
the earth trembled and shook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19 Your way was in the sea,&lt;br&gt;
and your paths in the great waters, *&lt;br&gt;
yet your footsteps were not seen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20 You led your people like a flock *&lt;br&gt;
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, &amp;ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&amp;rdquo; If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the days drew near for Jesus to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&amp;rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were going along the road, someone said to him, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you wherever you go.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&amp;rdquo; To another he said, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo; But he said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&amp;rdquo; But Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; Another said, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.” (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, “Follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &amp;ldquo;So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&amp;rdquo; Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he himself went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: &amp;ldquo;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.&amp;rdquo; [Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and eat.&amp;rdquo; He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel of the LORD came a second time, touched him, and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.&amp;quot;] He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.&amp;rdquo; Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&amp;rdquo; Then the LORD said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quemadmodum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, *&lt;br&gt;
so longs my soul for you, O God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; *&lt;br&gt;
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	My tears have been my food day and night, *&lt;br&gt;
while all day long they say to me,&lt;br&gt;
Where now is your God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; *&lt;br&gt;
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *&lt;br&gt;
among those who keep holy-day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *&lt;br&gt;
and why are you so disquieted within me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Put your trust in God; *&lt;br&gt;
for I will yet give thanks to him,&lt;br&gt;
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	My soul is heavy within me; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan,&lt;br&gt;
and from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; *&lt;br&gt;
all your rapids and floods have gone over me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; *&lt;br&gt;
in the night season his song is with me,&lt;br&gt;
a prayer to the God of my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I will say to the God of my strength,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why have you forgotten me? *&lt;br&gt;
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy&lt;br&gt;
oppresses me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	While my bones are being broken, *&lt;br&gt;
my enemies mock me to my face;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	All day long they mock me *&lt;br&gt;
and say to me, &amp;ldquo;Where now is your God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *&lt;br&gt;
and why are you so disquieted within me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Put your trust in God; *&lt;br&gt;
for I will yet give thanks to him,&lt;br&gt;
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judica me, Deus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Give judgment for me, O God,&lt;br&gt;
and defend my cause against an ungodly people; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	For you are the God of my strength;&lt;br&gt;
why have you put me from you? *&lt;br&gt;
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy&lt;br&gt;
oppresses me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, *&lt;br&gt;
and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	That I may go to the altar of God,&lt;br&gt;
to the God of my joy and gladness; *&lt;br&gt;
and on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *&lt;br&gt;
and why are you so disquieted within me?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Put your trust in God; *&lt;br&gt;
for I will yet give thanks to him,&lt;br&gt;
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to the promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. As he stepped out on land, a man of the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice, &amp;ldquo;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; for Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds.) Jesus then asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is your name?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Legion&amp;rdquo;; for many demons had entered him. They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, &amp;ldquo;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&amp;rdquo; So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.&lt;/p&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, by whose providence your servant John the Baptist was wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of your Son our Savior by preaching repentance: Make us so to follow his teaching and holy life, that we may truly repent according to his preaching; and, following his example, constantly speak the truth, boldly rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the truth’s sake; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.&lt;br&gt;
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her&lt;br&gt;
that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid,&lt;br&gt;
that she has received from the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand double for all her sins.&lt;br&gt;
A voice cries out:&lt;br&gt;
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;br&gt;
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low;&lt;br&gt;
the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.&lt;br&gt;
Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”&lt;br&gt;
A voice says, “Cry out!” And I said, “What shall I cry?”&lt;br&gt;
All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.&lt;br&gt;
Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings;&lt;br&gt;
lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear;&lt;br&gt;
say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”&lt;br&gt;
See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him;&lt;br&gt;
his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.&lt;br&gt;
He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms,&lt;br&gt;
and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedixisti, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	You have been gracious to your land, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *&lt;br&gt;
and blotted out all their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have withdrawn all your fury *&lt;br&gt;
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
let your anger depart from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? *&lt;br&gt;
will you prolong your anger from age to age?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Will you not give us life again, *&lt;br&gt;
that your people may rejoice in you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and grant us your salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, *&lt;br&gt;
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people&lt;br&gt;
and to those who turn their hearts to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
that his glory may dwell in our land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Mercy and truth have met together; *&lt;br&gt;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, *&lt;br&gt;
and our land will yield its increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Righteousness shall go before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: “You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’ Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised; before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father. But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.” They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.” Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him. He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God. Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea. All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favourably on his people and redeemed them.&lt;br&gt;
He has raised up a mighty saviour for us in the house of his servant David,&lt;br&gt;
as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.&lt;br&gt;
Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant,&lt;br&gt;
the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,&lt;br&gt;
might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.”&lt;br&gt;
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,&lt;br&gt;
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;br&gt;
By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us,&lt;br&gt;
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. And Ahab said to Naboth, &amp;ldquo;Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.&amp;rdquo; But Naboth said to Ahab, &amp;ldquo;The LORD forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance.&amp;rdquo; Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, &amp;ldquo;I will not give you my ancestral inheritance.&amp;rdquo; He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife Jezebel came to him and said, &amp;ldquo;Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?&amp;rdquo; He said to her, &amp;ldquo;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, &lt;code&gt;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it&#39;; but he answered, &lt;/code&gt;I will not give you my vineyard.&#39;&amp;rdquo; His wife Jezebel said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she wrote letters in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. She wrote in the letters, &amp;ldquo;Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly; seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, `You have cursed God and the king.&amp;rsquo; Then take him out, and stone him to death.&amp;rdquo; [The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly. The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &amp;ldquo;Naboth cursed God and the king.&amp;rdquo; So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &amp;ldquo;Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, &amp;ldquo;Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&amp;rdquo; As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. You shall say to him, &amp;ldquo;Thus says the LORD: Have you killed, and also taken possession?&amp;rdquo; You shall say to him, &amp;ldquo;Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahab said to Elijah, &amp;ldquo;Have you found me, O my enemy?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, I will bring disaster on you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

because of those who lie in wait for me; *&lt;br&gt;
make your way straight before me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law. But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor. For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee&amp;rsquo;s house and took his place at the table. And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee&amp;rsquo;s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him&amp;ndash; that she is a sinner.&amp;rdquo; Jesus spoke up and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Simon, I have something to say to you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Teacher,&amp;rdquo; he replied, &amp;ldquo;Speak.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?&amp;rdquo; Simon answered, &amp;ldquo;I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;You have judged rightly.&amp;rdquo; Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to her, &amp;ldquo;Your sins are forgiven.&amp;rdquo; But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, &amp;ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&amp;rdquo; And he said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Herod&amp;rsquo;s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty and everlasting God, you have given to us your servants grace, by the confession of a true faith, to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity, and in the power of your divine Majesty to worship the Unity: Keep us steadfast in this faith and worship, and bring us at last to see you in your one and eternal glory, O Father; who with the Son and the Holy Spirit live and reign, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Proverbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?&lt;br&gt;
On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;&lt;br&gt;
beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.&lt;br&gt;
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.&lt;br&gt;
Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world&amp;rsquo;s first bits of soil.&lt;br&gt;
When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,&lt;br&gt;
when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,&lt;br&gt;
when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command,&lt;br&gt;
when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master worker;&lt;br&gt;
and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,&lt;br&gt;
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-8&#34;&gt;Psalm 8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, Dominus noster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *&lt;br&gt;
your majesty is praised above the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
to quell the enemy and the avenger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *&lt;br&gt;
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_romans-51-5_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Romans 5:1-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God&amp;rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;br&gt;
Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the end of the earth!&lt;br&gt;
Let the sea roar and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants.&lt;br&gt;
Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits;&lt;br&gt;
let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the tops of the mountains.&lt;br&gt;
Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the coastlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
Happy are they who fear the Lord *&lt;br&gt;
and have great delight in his commandments!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their descendants will be mighty in the land; *&lt;br&gt;
the generation of the upright will be blessed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Wealth and riches will be in their house, *&lt;br&gt;
and their righteousness will last for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Light shines in the darkness for the upright; *&lt;br&gt;
the righteous are merciful and full of compassion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	It is good for them to be generous in lending *&lt;br&gt;
and to manage their affairs with justice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For they will never be shaken; *&lt;br&gt;
the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *&lt;br&gt;
their heart is right;&lt;br&gt;
they put their trust in the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Their heart is established and will not shrink, *&lt;br&gt;
until they see their desire upon their enemies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	They have given freely to the poor, *&lt;br&gt;
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;&lt;br&gt;
they will hold up their head with honor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The wicked will see it and be angry;&lt;br&gt;
they will gnash their teeth and pine away; *&lt;br&gt;
the desires of the wicked will perish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews. But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion; for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve, “As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift up your hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, on this day you opened the way of eternal life to every race and nation by the promised gift of your Holy Spirit: Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&amp;rdquo; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, &amp;ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&amp;rdquo; The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built. And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another&amp;rsquo;s speech.&amp;rdquo; So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-3312-22&#34;&gt;Psalm 33:12-22&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exultate, justi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 The LORD looks down from heaven, *&lt;br&gt;
and beholds all the people in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 From where he sits enthroned he turns his gaze *&lt;br&gt;
on all who dwell on the earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 He fashions all the hearts of them *&lt;br&gt;
and understands all their works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 There is no king that can be saved by a mighty army; *&lt;br&gt;
a strong man is not delivered by his great strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 The horse is a vain hope for deliverance; *&lt;br&gt;
for all its strength it cannot save.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
on those who wait upon his love,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 To pluck their lives from death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to feed them in time of famine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 Our soul waits for the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he is our help and our shield.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *&lt;br&gt;
for in his holy Name we put our trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, *&lt;br&gt;
as we have put our trust in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_acts-21-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Acts 2:1-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&amp;ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s deeds of power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the festival, the great day, while Jesus was standing there, he cried out, &amp;ldquo;Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, `Out of the believer&amp;rsquo;s heart shall flow rivers of living water.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in him were to receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, on this day you opened the way of eternal life to every race and nation by the promised gift of your Holy Spirit: Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&amp;ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&amp;rsquo;s deeds of power.&amp;rdquo; All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &amp;ldquo;What does this mean?&amp;rdquo; But others sneered and said, &amp;ldquo;They are filled with new wine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`In the last days it will be, God declares,&lt;br&gt;
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,&lt;br&gt;
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.&lt;br&gt;
Even upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.&lt;br&gt;
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist.&lt;br&gt;
The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s great and glorious day.&lt;br&gt;
Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24	Man goes forth to his work *&lt;br&gt;
and to his labor until the evening.&lt;br&gt;
25	&lt;strong&gt;O LORD, how manifold are your works! *&lt;br&gt;
in wisdom you have made them all;&lt;br&gt;
the earth is full of your creatures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26	Yonder is the great and wide sea&lt;br&gt;
with its living things too many to number, *&lt;br&gt;
creatures both small and great.&lt;br&gt;
27	&lt;strong&gt;There move the ships,&lt;br&gt;
and there is that Leviathan, *&lt;br&gt;
which you have made for the sport of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28	All of them look to you *&lt;br&gt;
to give them their food in due season.&lt;br&gt;
29	&lt;strong&gt;You give it to them; they gather it; *&lt;br&gt;
you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30	You hide your face, and they are terrified; *&lt;br&gt;
you take away their breath,&lt;br&gt;
and they die and return to their dust.&lt;br&gt;
31	&lt;strong&gt;You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; *&lt;br&gt;
and so you renew the face of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32	May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
may the LORD rejoice in all his works.&lt;br&gt;
33	&lt;strong&gt;He looks at the earth and it trembles; *&lt;br&gt;
he touches the mountains and they smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; *&lt;br&gt;
I will praise my God while I have my being.&lt;br&gt;
35	&lt;strong&gt;May these words of mine please him; *&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37	Bless the LORD, O my soul. *&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; it is that very Spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ&amp;ndash; if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father&amp;rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;I have said these things to you while I am still with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father in heaven, by your grace the virgin mother of your incarnate Son was blessed in bearing him, but still more blessed in keeping your word: Grant us who honor the exaltation of her lowliness to follow the example of her devotion to your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah prayed and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My heart exults in the Lord;&lt;br&gt;
my strength is exalted in my God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My mouth derides my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
because I rejoice in my victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There is no Holy One like the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
no one besides you;&lt;br&gt;
there is no Rock like our God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Talk no more so very proudly,&lt;br&gt;
let not arrogance come from your mouth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the Lord is a God of knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
and by him actions are weighed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The bows of the mighty are broken,&lt;br&gt;
but the feeble gird on strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,&lt;br&gt;
but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The barren has borne seven,&lt;br&gt;
but she who has many children is forlorn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord kills and brings to life;&lt;br&gt;
he brings down to Sheol and raises up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Lord makes poor and makes rich;&lt;br&gt;
he brings low, he also exalts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raises up the poor from the dust;&lt;br&gt;
he lifts the needy from the ash heap,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;to make them sit with princes&lt;br&gt;
and inherit a seat of honour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s,&lt;br&gt;
and on them he has set the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;‘He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,&lt;br&gt;
but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness;&lt;br&gt;
for not by might does one prevail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered;&lt;br&gt;
the Most High will thunder in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
he will give strength to his king,&lt;br&gt;
and exalt the power of his anointed.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6	He takes up the weak out of the dust *&lt;br&gt;
and lifts up the poor from the ashes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He sets them with the princes, *&lt;br&gt;
with the princes of his people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He makes the woman of a childless house *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good; love one another with mutual affection; outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth heard Mary&amp;rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;br&gt;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;br&gt;
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&lt;br&gt;
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&lt;br&gt;
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&lt;br&gt;
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.&lt;/p&gt;

he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;

that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Paul and Silas, we came to Philippi in Macedonia, a Roman colony, and, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling. While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, &amp;ldquo;These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.&amp;rdquo; She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &amp;ldquo;I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&amp;rdquo; And it came out that very hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, &amp;ldquo;These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe.&amp;rdquo; The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods. After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely. Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&amp;rsquo;s chains were unfastened. When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul shouted in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&amp;rdquo; The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them outside and said, &amp;ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&amp;rdquo; They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay. He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-97&#34;&gt;Psalm 97&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regnavit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is King;&lt;br&gt;
let the earth rejoice; *&lt;br&gt;
let the multitude of the isles be glad.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Clouds and darkness are round about him, *&lt;br&gt;
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	A fire goes before him *&lt;br&gt;
and burns up his enemies on every side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	His lightnings light up the world; *&lt;br&gt;
the earth sees it and is afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The heavens declare his righteousness, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the peoples see his glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Confounded be all who worship carved images&lt;br&gt;
and delight in false gods! *&lt;br&gt;
Bow down before him, all you gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *&lt;br&gt;
because of your judgments, O LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For you are the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
most high over all the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
you are exalted far above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The LORD loves those who hate evil; *&lt;br&gt;
he preserves the lives of his saints&lt;br&gt;
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Light has sprung up for the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
and give thanks to his holy Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the visions I, John, heard these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone&amp;rsquo;s work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit and the bride say, &amp;ldquo;Come.&amp;rdquo; And let everyone who hears say, &amp;ldquo;Come.&amp;rdquo; And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one who testifies to these things says, &amp;ldquo;Surely I am coming soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus prayed for his disciples, and then he said. &amp;ldquo;I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become completely one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that those also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory, which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you; and these know that you have sent me. I made your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. &amp;ldquo;This,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;is what you have heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when they had come together, they asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, &amp;ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-47&#34;&gt;Psalm 47&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omnes gentes, plaudite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Clap your hands, all you peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
shout to God with a cry of joy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	For the LORD Most High is to be feared; *&lt;br&gt;
he is the great King over all the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He subdues the peoples under us, *&lt;br&gt;
and the nations under our feet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He chooses our inheritance for us, *&lt;br&gt;
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	God has gone up with a shout, *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD with the sound of the ram&amp;rsquo;s-horn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Sing praises to God, sing praises; *&lt;br&gt;
sing praises to our King, sing praises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For God is King of all the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
sing praises with all your skill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	God reigns over the nations; *&lt;br&gt;
God sits upon his holy throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The nobles of the peoples have gathered together *&lt;br&gt;
with the people of the God of Abraham.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The rulers of the earth belong to God, *&lt;br&gt;
and he is highly exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_ephesians-115-23_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Ephesians 1:15-23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them. While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy; and they were continually in the temple blessing God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the night Paul had a vision: there stood a man of Macedonia pleading with him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&amp;rdquo; When he had seen the vision, we immediately tried to cross over to Macedonia, being convinced that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set sail from Troas and took a straight course to Samothrace, the following day to Neapolis, and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days. On the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there. A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, &amp;ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home.&amp;rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-67&#34;&gt;Psalm 67&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus misereatur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	May God be merciful to us and bless us, *&lt;br&gt;
show us the light of his countenance and come to us.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Let your ways be known upon earth, *&lt;br&gt;
your saving health among all nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Let the peoples praise you, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
let all the peoples praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for you judge the peoples with equity&lt;br&gt;
and guide all the nations upon earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Let the peoples praise you, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
let all the peoples praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The earth has brought forth her increase; *&lt;br&gt;
may God, our own God, give us his blessing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	May God give us his blessing, *&lt;br&gt;
and may all the ends of the earth stand in awe of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit the angel carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never be shut by day&amp;ndash; and there will be no night there. People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s book of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to Judas (not Iscariot), &amp;ldquo;Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; and the word that you hear is not mine, but is from the Father who sent me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have said these things to you while I am still with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, `I am going away, and I am coming to you.&amp;rsquo; If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you this before it occurs, so that when it does occur, you may believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?&amp;rdquo; Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying, &amp;ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. I also heard a voice saying to me, &lt;code&gt;Get up, Peter; kill and eat.&#39; But I replied, &lt;/code&gt;By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&amp;rsquo; But a second time the voice answered from heaven, &lt;code&gt;What God has made clean, you must not call profane.&#39; This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven. At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were. The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&#39;s house. He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, &lt;/code&gt;Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter; he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.&amp;rsquo; And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, `John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rsquo; If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?&amp;rdquo; When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, &amp;ldquo;Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

old and young together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Let them praise the Name of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
for his Name only is exalted,&lt;br&gt;
his splendor is over earth and heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	He has raised up strength for his people&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_revelation-211-6_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Revelation 21:1-6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the one who was seated on the throne said, &amp;ldquo;See, I am making all things new.&amp;rdquo; Also he said, &amp;ldquo;Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last supper, when Judas had gone out, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &amp;lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.&amp;rsquo; I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, &amp;ldquo;Please come to us without delay.&amp;rdquo; So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, &amp;ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&amp;rdquo; Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regit me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *&lt;br&gt;
and leads me beside still waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom&lt;br&gt;
and thanksgiving and honor&lt;br&gt;
and power and might&lt;br&gt;
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&amp;rdquo; I said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.&lt;br&gt;
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;&lt;br&gt;
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,&lt;br&gt;
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &amp;ldquo;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father&amp;rsquo;s name testify to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father&amp;rsquo;s hand. The Father and I are one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD waits to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show mercy to you.&lt;br&gt;
For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, O people in Zion, inhabitants of Jerusalem, you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left, your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is the way; walk in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legem pone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, *&lt;br&gt;
and I shall keep it to the end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall keep it with all my heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 Make me go in the path of your commandments, *&lt;br&gt;
for that is my desire.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;36 Incline my heart to your decrees *&lt;br&gt;
and not to unjust gain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37 Turn my eyes from watching what is worthless; *&lt;br&gt;
give me life in your ways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;38 Fulfill your promise to your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
which you make to those who fear you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39 Turn away the reproach which I dread, *&lt;br&gt;
because your judgments are good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;40 Behold, I long for your commandments; *&lt;br&gt;
in your righteousness preserve my life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is by God&amp;rsquo;s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&amp;rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&amp;rsquo; sake. For it is the God who said, &amp;ldquo;Let light shine out of darkness,&amp;rdquo; who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father&amp;rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &amp;ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&amp;rdquo; He asked, &amp;ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&amp;rdquo; The reply came, &amp;ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&amp;rdquo; [The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &amp;ldquo;Ananias.&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&amp;rdquo; The Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&amp;rdquo; But Ananias answered, &amp;ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.&amp;rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel; I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&amp;rdquo; So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, &amp;ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &amp;ldquo;He is the Son of God.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-30&#34;&gt;Psalm 30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exaltabo te, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will exalt you, O LORD,&lt;br&gt;
because you have lifted me up *&lt;br&gt;
and have not let my enemies triumph over me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *&lt;br&gt;
and you restored me to health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *&lt;br&gt;
you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *&lt;br&gt;
give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *&lt;br&gt;
his favor for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Weeping may spend the night, *&lt;br&gt;
but joy comes in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	While I felt secure, I said,&lt;br&gt;
I shall never be disturbed. *&lt;br&gt;
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as&lt;br&gt;
the mountains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Then you hid your face, *&lt;br&gt;
and I was filled with fear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	I cried to you, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
I pleaded with the Lord, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	&amp;ldquo;What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *&lt;br&gt;
will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, be my helper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You have turned my wailing into dancing; *&lt;br&gt;
you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, singing with full voice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered&lt;br&gt;
to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might&lt;br&gt;
and honor and glory and blessing!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb&lt;br&gt;
be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the four living creatures said, &amp;ldquo;Amen!&amp;rdquo; And the elders fell down and worshiped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am going fishing.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;We will go with you.&amp;rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&amp;rdquo; They answered him, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&amp;rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;It is the Lord!&amp;rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&amp;rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&amp;rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Feed my lambs.&amp;rdquo; A second time he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Tend my sheep.&amp;rdquo; He said to him the third time, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;rdquo; Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, &amp;ldquo;Do you love me?&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.&amp;rdquo; (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,&lt;br&gt;
who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, &amp;ldquo;Your God reigns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;&lt;br&gt;
for in plain sight they see the return of the LORD to Zion.&lt;br&gt;
Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations;&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quare fremuerunt gentes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Why are the nations in an uproar? *&lt;br&gt;
Why do the peoples mutter empty threats?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt,&lt;br&gt;
and the princes plot together, *&lt;br&gt;
against the LORD and against his Anointed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	&amp;ldquo;Let us break their yoke,&amp;rdquo; they say; *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;let us cast off their bonds from us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He whose throne is in heaven is laughing; *&lt;br&gt;
the Lord has them in derision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, *&lt;br&gt;
and his rage fills them with terror.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	&amp;ldquo;I myself have set my king *&lt;br&gt;
upon my holy hill of Zion.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Let me announce the decree of the LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son;&lt;br&gt;
this day have I begotten you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for&lt;br&gt;
your inheritance *&lt;br&gt;
and the ends of the earth for your possession.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	You shall crush them with an iron rod *&lt;br&gt;
and shatter them like a piece of pottery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	And now, you kings, be wise; *&lt;br&gt;
be warned, you rulers of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Submit to the LORD with fear, *&lt;br&gt;
and with trembling bow before him;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Lest he be angry and you perish; *&lt;br&gt;
for his wrath is quickly kindled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13	Happy are they all *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ&amp;rsquo;s gift. Therefore it is said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people&amp;rsquo;s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body&amp;rsquo;s growth in building itself up in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;&lt;br&gt;
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: `Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&amp;rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, &amp;ldquo;The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &amp;ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

Lord God, Lamb of God,&lt;br&gt;

Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the temple police had brought the apostles, they had them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them, saying, &amp;ldquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man&amp;rsquo;s blood on us.&amp;rdquo; But Peter and the apostles answered, &amp;ldquo;We must obey God rather than any human authority. The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 The LORD is my strength and my song, *&lt;br&gt;
and he has become my salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 There is a sound of exultation and victory *&lt;br&gt;
in the tents of the righteous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 &amp;ldquo;The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! *&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 I shall not die, but live, *&lt;br&gt;
and declare the works of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 The LORD has punished me sorely, *&lt;br&gt;
but he did not hand me over to death.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will enter them;&lt;br&gt;
I will offer thanks to the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he who is righteous may enter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and have become my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22 The same stone which the builders rejected *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;23 This is the LORD&amp;rsquo;S doing, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is marvelous in our eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 On this day the LORD has acted; *&lt;br&gt;
we will rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;25 Hosannah, LORD, hosannah! *&lt;br&gt;
LORD, send us now success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; *&lt;br&gt;
we bless you from the house of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;27 God is the LORD; he has shined upon us; *&lt;br&gt;
form a procession with branches up to the horns of the altar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28 &amp;ldquo;You are my God, and I will thank you; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my God, and I will exalt you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;29 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; *&lt;br&gt;
his mercy endures for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood, and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes of the earth will wail. So it is to be. Amen. &amp;ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&amp;rdquo; says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &amp;ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&amp;rdquo; But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;rdquo; Thomas answered him, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and my God!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus. When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another. They said, ‘What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it. But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.’ So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered them, ‘Whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.’ After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shorter Ending of Mark[[And all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter. And afterwards Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. ]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Longer Ending of Mark[[Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping. But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it. After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. And he said to them, ‘Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it. ]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them, much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead. So they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who heard the word believed; and they numbered about five thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, &amp;ldquo;By what power or by what name did you do this?&amp;rdquo; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &amp;ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead. This Jesus is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 I love the  LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *&lt;br&gt;
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 The cords of death entangled me;&lt;br&gt;
the grip of the grave took hold of me; *&lt;br&gt;
I came to grief and sorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Then I called upon the Name of the  LORD: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;O  LORD, I pray you, save my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Gracious is the  LORD and righteous; *&lt;br&gt;
our God is full of compassion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 The  LORD watches over the innocent; *&lt;br&gt;
I was brought very low, and he helped me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Turn again to your rest, O my soul, *&lt;br&gt;
for the  LORD has treated you well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 For you have rescued my life from death, *&lt;br&gt;
my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 I will walk in the presence of the  LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the land of the living.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am going fishing.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;We will go with you.&amp;rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&amp;rdquo; They answered him, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&amp;rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;It is the Lord!&amp;rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&amp;rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&amp;rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;

that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lame man whom Peter and John had healed clung to them, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Portico, utterly astonished. When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, &amp;ldquo;You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus, who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets. Moses said, &lt;code&gt;The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you. And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.&#39; And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days. You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, &lt;/code&gt;And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&amp;rsquo; When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *&lt;br&gt;
your majesty is praised above the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
to quell the enemy and the avenger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *&lt;br&gt;
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus stood among the disciples and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&amp;rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&amp;rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon. And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms. Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, &amp;ldquo;Look at us.&amp;rdquo; And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk.&amp;rdquo; And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Sing to him, sing praises to him, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Glory in his holy Name; *&lt;br&gt;
let the hearts of those who seek the  LORD rejoice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Search for the  LORD and his strength; *&lt;br&gt;
continually seek his face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Remember the marvels he has done, *&lt;br&gt;
his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, *&lt;br&gt;
O children of Jacob his chosen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 He is the  LORD our God; *&lt;br&gt;
his judgments prevail in all the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 He has always been mindful of his covenant, *&lt;br&gt;
the promise he made for a thousand generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, who by the glorious resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ destroyed death and brought life and immortality to light: Grant that we, who have been raised with him, may abide in his presence and rejoice in the hope of eternal glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be dominion and praise for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter said to the multitude, &amp;ldquo;Let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and to the other apostles, &amp;ldquo;Brothers, what should we do?&amp;rdquo; Peter said to them, &amp;ldquo;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.&amp;rdquo; And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, &amp;ldquo;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&amp;rdquo; So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 Our soul waits for the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he is our help and our shield.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *&lt;br&gt;
for in his holy Name we put our trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant, we pray, Almighty God, that we who celebrate with awe the Paschal feast may be found worthy to attain to everlasting joys; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the multitude, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know&amp;ndash; this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;&lt;br&gt;
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.&lt;br&gt;
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.&lt;br&gt;
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-168-11&#34;&gt;Psalm 16:8-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conserva me, Domine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8&lt;br&gt;
I have set the LORD always before me; *&lt;br&gt;
because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;br&gt;
My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *&lt;br&gt;
my body also shall rest in hope.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;br&gt;
For you will not abandon me to the grave, *&lt;br&gt;
nor let your holy one see the Pit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;br&gt;
You will show me the path of life; *&lt;br&gt;
in your presence there is fullness of joy,&lt;br&gt;
and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus met Mary Magdalene and the other Mary and said, &amp;ldquo;Greetings!&amp;rdquo; And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them, &amp;ldquo;You must say, `His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&amp;rsquo; If this comes to the governor&amp;rsquo;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&amp;rdquo; So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear.&lt;br&gt;
And he will destroy on this mountain the shroud that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever.&lt;br&gt;
Then the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.&lt;br&gt;
It will be said on that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose NAME was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&amp;rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&amp;rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confitemini Domino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *&lt;br&gt;
his mercy endures for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let Israel now proclaim, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 The LORD is my strength and my song, *&lt;br&gt;
and he has become my salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 There is a sound of exultation and victory *&lt;br&gt;
in the tents of the righteous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 &amp;ldquo;The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! *&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!&lt;br&gt;
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 I shall not die, but live, *&lt;br&gt;
and declare the works of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 The LORD has punished me sorely, *&lt;br&gt;
but he did not hand me over to death.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will enter them;&lt;br&gt;
I will offer thanks to the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;ldquo;This is the gate of the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he who is righteous may enter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *&lt;br&gt;
and have become my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 The same stone which the builders rejected *&lt;br&gt;
has become the chief cornerstone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;23 This is the LORD&amp;rsquo;s doing, *&lt;br&gt;
and it is marvelous in our eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 On this day the LORD has acted; *&lt;br&gt;
we will rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died. For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&amp;rsquo; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and rested on this holy Sabbath, so we may await with him the coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of life; who now lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job said, &amp;ldquo;A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble, comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow and does not last.&lt;br&gt;
Do you fix your eyes on such a one? Do you bring me into judgment with you?&lt;br&gt;
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one can.&lt;br&gt;
Since their days are determined, and the number of their months is known to you, and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,&lt;br&gt;
look away from them, and desist, that they may enjoy, like laborers, their days.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.&lt;br&gt;
Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,&lt;br&gt;
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.&lt;br&gt;
But mortals die, and are laid low; humans expire, and where are they?&lt;br&gt;
As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,&lt;br&gt;
so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused out of their sleep.&lt;br&gt;
Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!&lt;br&gt;
If mortals die, will they live again? All the days of my service I would wait until my release should come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-311-415-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 31:1-4,15-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, &lt;code&gt;After three days I will rise again.&#39; Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, &lt;/code&gt;He has been raised from the dead,&amp;rsquo; and the last deception would be worse than the first.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&amp;rdquo; So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so. God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.” So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in, they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.&amp;rdquo; Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

Lord God, Lamb of God,&lt;br&gt;
you take away the sin of the world:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him &amp;ndash;so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;br&gt;
Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;br&gt;
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&lt;br&gt;
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away. Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the LORD shall prosper. Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *&lt;br&gt;
and are so far from my cry&lt;br&gt;
and from the words of my distress?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Many young bulls encircle me; *&lt;br&gt;
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the families of the nations bow before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he rules over the nations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *&lt;br&gt;
all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	My soul shall live for him;&lt;br&gt;
my descendants shall serve him; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be known as the LORD&amp;rsquo;S for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *&lt;br&gt;
the saving deeds that he has done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit testifies saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he also adds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I am he.&amp;rdquo; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am he,&amp;rdquo; they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; And they said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, &amp;ldquo;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&amp;rdquo; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest&amp;rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave&amp;rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of this man&amp;rsquo;s disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &amp;ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&amp;rdquo; Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of his disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He denied it and said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &amp;ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&amp;rdquo; Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate&amp;rsquo;s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, &amp;ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&amp;rdquo; The Jews replied, &amp;ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death.&amp;rdquo; (This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?&amp;rdquo; Pilate replied, &amp;ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;So you are a king?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is truth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &amp;ldquo;I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; They shouted in reply, &amp;ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!&amp;rdquo; Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&amp;rdquo; and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Here is the man!&amp;rdquo; When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted, &amp;ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; The Jews answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&amp;rdquo; From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, &amp;ldquo;If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&amp;rsquo;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &amp;ldquo;Here is your King!&amp;rdquo; They cried out, &amp;ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked them, &amp;ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&amp;rdquo; The chief priests answered, &amp;ldquo;We have no king but the emperor.&amp;rdquo; Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo; Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &amp;ldquo;Do not write, &amp;lsquo;The King of the Jews,&amp;rsquo; but, &amp;lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Pilate answered, &amp;ldquo;What I have written I have written.&amp;rdquo; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &amp;ldquo;Woman, here is your son.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to the disciple, &amp;ldquo;Here is your mother.&amp;rdquo; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &amp;ldquo;I am thirsty.&amp;rdquo; A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &amp;ldquo;It is finished.&amp;rdquo; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;None of his bones shall be broken.&amp;rdquo; And again another passage of scripture says, &amp;ldquo;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *&lt;br&gt;
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever&lt;br&gt;
I called upon him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	How shall I repay the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
for all the good things he has done for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I will lift up the cup of salvation *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Precious in the sight of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
is the death of his servants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	O LORD, I am your servant; *&lt;br&gt;
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid;&lt;br&gt;
you have freed me from my bonds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *&lt;br&gt;
and call upon the Name of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the presence of all his people,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	In the courts of the LORD&amp;rsquo;S house, *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, `Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&amp;rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&amp;ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&amp;ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&amp;rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&amp;rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &amp;ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&amp;rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had gone out, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, by the passion of your blessed Son you made an instrument of shameful death to be for us the means of life: Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may gladly suffer shame and loss for the sake of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
But I said, &amp;ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-711-14&#34;&gt;Psalm 71:1-14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *&lt;br&gt;
let me never be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my crag and my stronghold.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *&lt;br&gt;
my confidence since I was young.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;&lt;br&gt;
from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *&lt;br&gt;
my praise shall be always of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 I have become a portent to many; *&lt;br&gt;
but you are my refuge and my strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Let my mouth be full of your praise *&lt;br&gt;
and your glory all the day long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Do not cast me off in my old age; *&lt;br&gt;
forsake me not when my strength fails.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my enemies are talking against me, *&lt;br&gt;
and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 They say, &amp;ldquo;God has forsaken him;&lt;br&gt;
go after him and seize him; *&lt;br&gt;
because there is none who will save.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 O God, be not far from me; *&lt;br&gt;
come quickly to help me, O my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *&lt;br&gt;
let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But I shall always wait in patience, *&lt;br&gt;
and shall praise you more and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-118-31_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 1:18-31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&amp;rdquo; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say&amp;ndash; `Father, save me from this hour&amp;rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&amp;rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&amp;rdquo; The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, &amp;ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&amp;rdquo; He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We lift them to the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-365-11&#34;&gt;Psalm 36:5-11&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixit injustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, *&lt;br&gt;
and your faithfulness to the clouds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,&lt;br&gt;
your justice like the great deep; *&lt;br&gt;
you save both man and beast, O Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 How priceless is your love, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *&lt;br&gt;
you give them drink from the river of your delights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For with you is the well of life, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your light we see light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *&lt;br&gt;
and your favor to those who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Let not the foot of the proud come near me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the hand of the wicked push me aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-911-15_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 9:11-15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of a teacher,&lt;br&gt;
that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.&lt;br&gt;
Morning by morning he wakens&amp;ndash; wakens my ear to listen as those who are taught.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I did not turn backward.&lt;br&gt;
I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;
Who will contend with me? Let us stand up together.&lt;br&gt;
Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;
It is the Lord GOD who helps me; who will declare me guilty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-319-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 31:9-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies&lt;br&gt;
and even to my neighbors,&lt;br&gt;
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *&lt;br&gt;
when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hour for the Passover meal came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo; And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, &amp;ldquo;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table. For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!&amp;rdquo; Then they began to ask one another, which one of them it could be who would do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to them, &amp;ldquo;When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?&amp;rdquo; They said, &amp;ldquo;No, not a thing.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, `And he was counted among the lawless&amp;rsquo;; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; They said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;It is enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Lord, should we strike with the sword?&amp;rdquo; Then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;No more of this!&amp;rdquo; And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him, &amp;ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest&amp;rsquo;s house. But Peter was following at a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said, &amp;ldquo;This man also was with him.&amp;rdquo; But he denied it, saying, &amp;ldquo;Woman, I do not know him.&amp;rdquo; A little later someone else, on seeing him, said, &amp;ldquo;You also are one of them.&amp;rdquo; But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Man, I am not!&amp;rdquo; Then about an hour later still another kept insisting, &amp;ldquo;Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.&amp;rdquo; But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Man, I do not know what you are talking about!&amp;rdquo; At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, &amp;ldquo;Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.&amp;rdquo; And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, &amp;ldquo;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&amp;rdquo; They kept heaping many other insults on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council. They said, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Messiah, tell us.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I question you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&amp;rdquo; All of them asked, &amp;ldquo;Are you, then, the Son of God?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am.&amp;rdquo; Then they said, &amp;ldquo;What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying, &amp;ldquo;We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.&amp;rdquo; Then Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;You say so.&amp;rdquo; Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &amp;ldquo;I find no basis for an accusation against this man.&amp;rdquo; But they were insistent and said, &amp;ldquo;He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that he was under Herod&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign. He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate. That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people, and said to them, &amp;ldquo;You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death. I will therefore have him flogged and release him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they all shouted out together, &amp;ldquo;Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!&amp;rdquo; (This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.) Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again; but they kept shouting, &amp;ldquo;Crucify, crucify him!&amp;rdquo; A third time he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.&amp;rdquo; But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted. He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus. A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him. But Jesus turned to them and said, &amp;ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For the days are surely coming when they will say, &amp;lsquo;Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.&amp;rsquo; Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &amp;lsquo;Fall on us&amp;rsquo;; and to the hills, &amp;lsquo;Cover us.&amp;rsquo; For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, while the sun&amp;rsquo;s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, &amp;ldquo;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.&amp;rdquo; Having said this, he breathed his last. When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, &amp;ldquo;Certainly this man was innocent.&amp;rdquo; And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts. But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council, had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almighty and everliving God,&lt;br&gt;
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lord God, heavenly King,&lt;br&gt;

we worship you,&lt;br&gt;

Lord God, Lamb of God,&lt;br&gt;
you take away the sin of the world:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-3&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you alone can bring into order the unruly wills and affections of sinners: Grant your people grace to love what you command and desire what you promise; that, among the swift and varied changes of the world, our hearts may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,&lt;br&gt;
who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior;&lt;br&gt;
they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:&lt;br&gt;
Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.&lt;br&gt;
I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?&lt;br&gt;
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.&lt;br&gt;
The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches;&lt;br&gt;
for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert,&lt;br&gt;
to give drink to my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself&lt;br&gt;
so that they might declare my praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-126&#34;&gt;Psalm 126&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In convertendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *&lt;br&gt;
then were we like those who dream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *&lt;br&gt;
and our tongue with shouts of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then they said among the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The LORD has done great things for us, *&lt;br&gt;
and we are glad indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
like the watercourses of the Negev.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Those who sowed with tears *&lt;br&gt;
will reap with songs of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *&lt;br&gt;
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_philippians-34b-14_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Philippians 3:4b-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-holy-gospel-_john-121-8_&#34;&gt;The Holy Gospel: &lt;em&gt;John 12:1-8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Joshua, &amp;ldquo;Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt.&amp;rdquo; And so that place is called Gilgal to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal they kept the passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho. On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-32&#34;&gt;Psalm 32&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beati quorum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, *&lt;br&gt;
and whose sin is put away!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Happy are they to whom the LORD imputes no guilt, *&lt;br&gt;
and in whose spirit there is no guile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, *&lt;br&gt;
because of my groaning all day long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; *&lt;br&gt;
my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you, *&lt;br&gt;
and did not conceal my guilt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I said, &amp;ldquo;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	You are my hiding-place;&lt;br&gt;
you preserve me from trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
you surround me with shouts of deliverance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	&amp;ldquo;I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go; *&lt;br&gt;
I will guide you with my eye.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; *&lt;br&gt;
who must be fitted with bit and bridle,&lt;br&gt;
or else they will not stay near you.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Great are the tribulations of the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
but mercy embraces those who trust in the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
shout for joy, all who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to Jesus. And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, &amp;ldquo;This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jesus told them this parable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There was a man who had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, &amp;lsquo;Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.&amp;rsquo; So he divided his property between them. A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he said, &amp;lsquo;How many of my father&amp;rsquo;s hired hands have bread enough and to spare, but here I am dying of hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, &amp;ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo; So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. Then the son said to him, &amp;lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&amp;rsquo; But the father said to his slaves, &amp;lsquo;Quickly, bring out a robe&amp;ndash;the best one&amp;ndash;and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!&amp;rsquo; And they began to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on. He replied, &amp;lsquo;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has got him back safe and sound.&amp;rsquo; Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him. But he answered his father, &amp;lsquo;Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!&amp;rsquo; Then the father said to him, &amp;lsquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	My heart is stirring with a noble song;&lt;br&gt;
let me recite what I have fashioned for the king; *&lt;br&gt;
my tongue shall be the pen of a skilled writer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You are the fairest of men; *&lt;br&gt;
grace flows from your lips,&lt;br&gt;
because God has blessed you for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Strap your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior, *&lt;br&gt;

and for the sake of justice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Your right hand will show you marvelous things; *&lt;br&gt;
your arrows are very sharp, O mighty warrior.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The peoples are falling at your feet, *&lt;br&gt;
and the king&amp;rsquo;s enemies are losing heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever, *&lt;br&gt;
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom;&lt;br&gt;
you love righteousness and hate iniquity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Therefore God, your God, has anointed you *&lt;br&gt;
with the oil of gladness above your fellows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, *&lt;br&gt;
and the music of strings from ivory palaces makes you glad.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Kings&amp;rsquo; daughters stand among the ladies of the court; *&lt;br&gt;
on your right hand is the queen,&lt;br&gt;
adorned with the gold of Ophir.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	&amp;ldquo;Hear, O daughter; consider and listen closely; *&lt;br&gt;
forget your people and your father&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	The king will have pleasure in your beauty; *&lt;br&gt;
he is your master; therefore do him honor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	The people of Tyre are here with a gift; *&lt;br&gt;
the rich among the people seek your favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	All glorious is the princess as she enters; *&lt;br&gt;
her gown is cloth-of-gold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	In embroidered apparel she is brought to the king; *&lt;br&gt;
after her the bridesmaids follow in procession.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	With joy and gladness they are brought, *&lt;br&gt;
and enter into the palace of the king.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	&amp;ldquo;In place of fathers, O king, you shall have sons; *&lt;br&gt;
you shall make them princes over all the earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	I will make your name to be remembered&lt;br&gt;
from one generation to another; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore nations will praise you for ever and ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;&lt;br&gt;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.&lt;br&gt;
Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said above, &amp;ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&amp;rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &amp;ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&amp;rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&amp;rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &amp;lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&amp;rsquo; and they ask me, &amp;lsquo;What is his name?&amp;rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&#39;” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deus, Deus meus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 O God, you are my God; eagerly I seek you; *&lt;br&gt;
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,&lt;br&gt;
as in a barren and dry land where there is no water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Therefore I have gazed upon you in your holy place, *&lt;br&gt;
that I might behold your power and your glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 For your loving-kindness is better than life itself; *&lt;br&gt;
my lips shall give you praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 So will I bless you as long as I live *&lt;br&gt;
and lift up my hands in your Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 My soul is content, as with marrow and fatness, *&lt;br&gt;
and my mouth praises you with joyful lips,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 When I remember you upon my bed, *&lt;br&gt;
and meditate on you in the night watches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 For you have been my helper, *&lt;br&gt;
and under the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 My soul clings to you; *&lt;br&gt;
your right hand holds me fast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, &amp;ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.&amp;rdquo; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come. So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that very time there were some present who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. He asked them, &amp;ldquo;Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them&amp;ndash;do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he told this parable: &amp;ldquo;A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said to the gardener, &amp;lsquo;See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &amp;lsquo;Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to Nathan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. When he commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use, with blows inflicted by human beings. But I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Your love, O LORD, for ever will I sing; *&lt;br&gt;
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	&amp;ldquo;I have made a covenant with my chosen one; *&lt;br&gt;

and preserve your throne for all generations.&#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The heavens bear witness to your wonders, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and to your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? *&lt;br&gt;
who is like the LORD among the gods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	God is much to be feared in the council of the holy ones, *&lt;br&gt;
great and terrible to all those round about him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Who is like you, LORD God of hosts? *&lt;br&gt;
O mighty LORD, your faithfulness is all around you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	You rule the raging of the sea *&lt;br&gt;
and still the surging of its waves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	You have crushed Rahab of the deep with a deadly wound; *&lt;br&gt;
you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Yours are the heavens; the earth also is yours; *&lt;br&gt;
you laid the foundations of the world and all that is in it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You have made the north and the south; *&lt;br&gt;
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	You have a mighty arm; *&lt;br&gt;
strong is your hand and high is your right hand.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Righteousness and justice are the foundations of your throne; *&lt;br&gt;
love and truth go before your face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Happy are the people who know the festal shout! *&lt;br&gt;
they walk, O LORD, in the light of your presence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	They rejoice daily in your Name; *&lt;br&gt;
they are jubilant in your righteousness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	For you are the glory of their strength, *&lt;br&gt;
and by your favor our might is exalted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Truly, the LORD is our ruler; *&lt;br&gt;
The Holy One of Israel is our King.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19	You spoke once in vision and said to your faithful people: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have set the crown upon a warrior&lt;br&gt;
and have exalted one chosen out of the people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	I have found David my servant; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	My hand will hold him fast *&lt;br&gt;
and my arm will make him strong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	No enemy shall deceive him, *&lt;br&gt;
nor any wicked man bring him down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	I will crush his foes before him *&lt;br&gt;
and strike down those who hate him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My faithfulness and love shall be with him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he shall be victorious through my Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	I shall make his dominion extend *&lt;br&gt;
from the Great Sea to the River.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	He will say to me, &amp;lsquo;You are my Father, *&lt;br&gt;
my God, and the rock of my salvation.&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27	I will make him my firstborn *&lt;br&gt;
and higher than the kings of the earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;28	I will keep my love for him for ever, *&lt;br&gt;
and my covenant will stand firm for him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29	I will establish his line for ever *&lt;br&gt;
and his throne as the days of heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;I have made you the father of many nations&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become &amp;ldquo;the father of many nations,&amp;rdquo; according to what was said, &amp;ldquo;So numerous shall your descendants be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parents of Jesus went to Jerusalem every year for the festival of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival. When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, &amp;ldquo;Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&amp;rsquo;s house?&amp;rdquo; But they did not understand what he said to them. Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.&lt;/p&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-2&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.” But the word of the LORD came to him, “This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.” He brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?” He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-27&#34;&gt;Psalm 27&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus illuminatio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my light and my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
whom then shall I fear? *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is the strength of my life;&lt;br&gt;
of whom then shall I be afraid?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, *&lt;br&gt;
it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Though an army should encamp against me, *&lt;br&gt;
yet my heart shall not be afraid;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	And though war should rise up against me, *&lt;br&gt;
yet will I put my trust in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
one thing I seek; *&lt;br&gt;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days&lt;br&gt;
of my life;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
and to seek him in his temple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling&lt;br&gt;
and set me high upon a rock.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Even now he lifts up my head *&lt;br&gt;
above my enemies round about me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation&lt;br&gt;
with sounds of great gladness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will sing and make music to the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on me and answer me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	You speak in my heart and say, &amp;ldquo;Seek my face.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Your face, LORD, will I seek.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Hide not your face from me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	You have been my helper;&lt;br&gt;
cast me not away; *&lt;br&gt;
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Though my father and my mother forsake me, *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD will sustain me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Show me your way, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
lead me on a level path, because of my enemies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
for false witnesses have risen up against me,&lt;br&gt;
and also those who speak malice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	What if I had not believed&lt;br&gt;
that I should see the goodness of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the land of the living!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	O tarry and await the LORD&amp;rsquo;S pleasure;&lt;br&gt;
be strong, and he shall comfort your heart; *&lt;br&gt;
wait patiently for the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Pharisees came and said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Go and tell that fox for me, &amp;lsquo;Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work. Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.&amp;rsquo; Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you. And I tell you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, &amp;lsquo;Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &amp;ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&amp;rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &amp;ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&amp;rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-911-29-16&#34;&gt;Psalm 91:1-2,9-16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qui habitat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
He shall say to the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are my refuge and my stronghold, *&lt;br&gt;
my God in whom I put my trust.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9  Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *&lt;br&gt;
and the Most High your habitation,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10  There shall no evil happen to you, *&lt;br&gt;
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11  For he shall give his angels charge over you, *&lt;br&gt;
to keep you in all your ways.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 They shall bear you in their hands, *&lt;br&gt;
lest you dash your foot against a stone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 You shall tread upon the lion and adder; *&lt;br&gt;
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Because he is bound to me in love,&lt;br&gt;
therefore will I deliver him; *&lt;br&gt;
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *&lt;br&gt;
I am with him in trouble;&lt;br&gt;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16  With long life will I satisfy him, *&lt;br&gt;
and show him my salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, &amp;ldquo;No one who believes in him will be put to shame.&amp;rdquo; For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, &amp;ldquo;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his baptism, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished. The devil said to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;It is written, &amp;lsquo;One does not live by bread alone.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, &amp;ldquo;To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;It is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;It is said, &amp;lsquo;Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&#39;&amp;rdquo; When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blow the trumpet in Zion;&lt;br&gt;
sound the alarm on my holy mountain!&lt;br&gt;
Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,&lt;br&gt;
for the day of the Lord is coming, it is near—&lt;br&gt;
a day of darkness and gloom,&lt;br&gt;
a day of clouds and thick darkness!&lt;br&gt;
Like blackness spread upon the mountains&lt;br&gt;
a great and powerful army comes;&lt;br&gt;
their like has never been from of old,&lt;br&gt;
nor will be again after them&lt;br&gt;
in ages to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even now, says the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
return to me with all your heart,&lt;br&gt;
with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;&lt;br&gt;
rend your hearts and not your clothing.&lt;br&gt;
Return to the Lord, your God,&lt;br&gt;
for he is gracious and merciful,&lt;br&gt;
slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love,&lt;br&gt;
and relents from punishing.&lt;br&gt;
Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,&lt;br&gt;
and leave a blessing behind him,&lt;br&gt;
a grain-offering and a drink-offering&lt;br&gt;
for the Lord, your God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blow the trumpet in Zion;&lt;br&gt;

Sanctify the congregation;&lt;br&gt;
assemble the aged;&lt;br&gt;
gather the children,&lt;br&gt;
even infants at the breast.&lt;br&gt;
Let the bridegroom leave his room,&lt;br&gt;
and the bride her canopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the vestibule and the altar&lt;br&gt;
let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep.&lt;br&gt;
Let them say, ‘Spare your people, O Lord,&lt;br&gt;
and do not make your heritage a mockery,&lt;br&gt;
a byword among the nations.&lt;br&gt;
Why should it be said among the peoples,&lt;br&gt;
“Where is their God?”’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *&lt;br&gt;
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, *&lt;br&gt;
and forget not all his benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He forgives all your sins *&lt;br&gt;
and heals all your infirmities;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He redeems your life from the grave *&lt;br&gt;
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He satisfies you with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and your youth is renewed like an eagle&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The LORD executes righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and judgment for all who are oppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He made his ways known to Moses *&lt;br&gt;
and his works to the children of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, *&lt;br&gt;
slow to anger and of great kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He will not always accuse us, *&lt;br&gt;
nor will he keep his anger for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *&lt;br&gt;
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	For as the heavens are high above the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	As far as the east is from the west, *&lt;br&gt;
so far has he removed our sins from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	As a father cares for his children, *&lt;br&gt;
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *&lt;br&gt;
he remembers that we are but dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Our days are like the grass; *&lt;br&gt;
we flourish like a flower of the field;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *&lt;br&gt;
and its place shall know it no more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever&lt;br&gt;
on those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
and his righteousness on children&amp;rsquo;s children;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	On those who keep his covenant *&lt;br&gt;
and remember his commandments and do them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	The LORD has set his throne in heaven, *&lt;br&gt;
and his kingship has dominion over all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,&lt;br&gt;
you mighty ones who do his bidding, *&lt;br&gt;
and hearken to the voice of his word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
you ministers of his who do his will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,&lt;br&gt;
in all places of his dominion; *&lt;br&gt;
bless the LORD, O my soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘At an acceptable time I have listened to you,&lt;br&gt;
and on a day of salvation I have helped you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labours, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see—we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is King;&lt;br&gt;
let the people tremble; *&lt;br&gt;
he is enthroned upon the cherubim;&lt;br&gt;
let the earth shake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD is great in Zion; *&lt;br&gt;
he is high above all peoples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Let them confess his Name, which is great and awesome; *&lt;br&gt;
he is the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	&amp;ldquo;O mighty King, lover of justice,&lt;br&gt;
you have established equity; *&lt;br&gt;
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and fall down before his footstool; *&lt;br&gt;
he is the Holy One.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Moses and Aaron among his priests,&lt;br&gt;
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *&lt;br&gt;
they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; *&lt;br&gt;
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	&amp;ldquo;O LORD our God, you answered them indeed; *&lt;br&gt;
you were a God who forgave them,&lt;br&gt;
yet punished them for their evil deeds.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God&lt;br&gt;
and worship him upon his holy hill; *&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD our God is the Holy One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_2-corinthians-312-42_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;2 Corinthians 3:12-4:2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness, not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside. But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside. Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since it is by God&amp;rsquo;s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&amp;rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, &amp;ldquo;This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!&amp;rdquo; When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. Just then a man from the crowd shouted, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son; he is my only child. Suddenly a spirit seizes him, and all at once he shrieks. It convulses him until he foams at the mouth; it mauls him and will scarcely leave him. I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You faithless and perverse generation, how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&amp;rdquo; While he was coming, the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. And all were astounded at the greatness of God.]&lt;/p&gt;

eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who in the place of Judas chose your faithful servant Matthias to be numbered among the Twelve: Grant that your Church, being delivered from false apostles, may always be guided and governed by faithful and true pastors; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said, &amp;ldquo;Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus&amp;ndash; for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.&amp;rdquo; (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) &amp;ldquo;For it is written in the book of Psalms,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it&amp;rsquo;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Let another take his position of overseer.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us&amp;ndash; one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection.&amp;rdquo; So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, you know everyone&amp;rsquo;s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-15&#34;&gt;Psalm 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, quis habitabit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *&lt;br&gt;
who may abide upon your holy hill?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *&lt;br&gt;
who speaks the truth from his heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	There is no guile upon his tongue;&lt;br&gt;
he does no evil to his friend; *&lt;br&gt;
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *&lt;br&gt;
but he honors those who fear the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	He has sworn to do no wrong *&lt;br&gt;
and does not take back his word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *&lt;br&gt;
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Whoever does these things *&lt;br&gt;
shall never be overthrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you. Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&amp;rsquo;s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one&amp;rsquo;s life for one&amp;rsquo;s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O Lord, you have taught us that without love whatever we do is worth nothing: Send your Holy Spirit and pour into our hearts your greatest gift, which is love, the true bond of peace and of all virtue, without which whoever lives is accounted dead before you. Grant this for the sake of your only Son Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph said to his brothers, &amp;ldquo;I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?&amp;rdquo; But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Joseph said to his brothers, &amp;ldquo;Come closer to me.&amp;rdquo; And they came closer. He said, &amp;ldquo;I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, &amp;lsquo;Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children&amp;rsquo;s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide for you there&amp;ndash;since there are five more years of famine to come&amp;ndash;so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
Do not fret yourself because of evildoers; *&lt;br&gt;
do not be jealous of those who do wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
For they shall soon wither like the grass, *&lt;br&gt;
and like the green grass fade away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Put your trust in the LORD and do good; *&lt;br&gt;
dwell in the land and feed on its riches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
Take delight in the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and he shall give you your heart&amp;rsquo;s desire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
Commit your way to the LORD and put your trust in him, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will bring it to pass.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
He will make your righteousness as clear as the light *&lt;br&gt;
and your just dealing as the noonday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;br&gt;
Be still before the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
and wait patiently for him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;br&gt;
Do not fret yourself over the one who prospers, *&lt;br&gt;
the one who succeeds in evil schemes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9&lt;br&gt;
Refrain from anger, leave rage alone; *&lt;br&gt;
do not fret yourself; it leads only to evil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;br&gt;
For evildoers shall be cut off, *&lt;br&gt;
but those who wait upon the LORD shall possess the land.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;br&gt;
In a little while the wicked shall be no more; *&lt;br&gt;
you shall search out their place, but they will not be there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;br&gt;
But the lowly shall possess the land; *&lt;br&gt;
they will delight in abundance of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41&lt;br&gt;
But the deliverance of the righteous comes from the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
he is their stronghold in time of trouble.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;42&lt;br&gt;
The LORD will help them and rescue them; *&lt;br&gt;
he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,&lt;br&gt;
because they seek refuge in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone will ask, &amp;ldquo;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?&amp;rdquo; Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, &amp;ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living being&amp;rdquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

God from God,&lt;br&gt;

begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, the strength of all who put their trust in you: Mercifully accept our prayers; and because in our weakness we can do nothing good without you, give us the help of your grace, that in keeping your commandments we may please you both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their strength, whose hearts turn away from the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief comes.&lt;br&gt;
They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed are those who trust in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream.&lt;br&gt;
It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green;&lt;br&gt;
in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit.&lt;br&gt;
The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse&amp;ndash; who can understand it?&lt;br&gt;
I the LORD test the mind and search the heart,&lt;br&gt;
to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-1&#34;&gt;Psalm 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beatus vir qui non abiit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
nor lingered in the way of sinners,&lt;br&gt;
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and they meditate on his law day and night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	They are like trees planted by streams of water,&lt;br&gt;
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *&lt;br&gt;
everything they do shall prosper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	It is not so with the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the way of the wicked is doomed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-1512-20_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 15:12-20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ&amp;ndash;whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have died in Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came down with the twelve apostles and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all in the crowd were trying to touch him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;priest&#34;&gt;Priest:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: &amp;ldquo;Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: &amp;ldquo;Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.&amp;rdquo; Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &amp;ldquo;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&amp;rdquo; And I said, &amp;ldquo;Here am I; send me!&amp;rdquo; [And he said, &amp;ldquo;Go and say to this people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Keep listening, but do not comprehend;&lt;br&gt;
keep looking, but do not understand.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
Make the mind of this people dull, and stop their ears, and shut their eyes,&lt;br&gt;
so that they may not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears,&lt;br&gt;
and comprehend with their minds, and turn and be healed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;How long, O Lord?&amp;rdquo; And he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Until cities lie waste without inhabitant,&lt;br&gt;
and houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate;&lt;br&gt;
until the Lord sends everyone far away, and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.&lt;br&gt;
Even if a tenth part remain in it, it will be burned again,&lt;br&gt;
like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains standing when it is felled.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
The holy seed is its stump.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-138&#34;&gt;Psalm 138&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confitebor tibi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *&lt;br&gt;
before the gods I will sing your praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	I will bow down toward your holy temple&lt;br&gt;
and praise your Name, *&lt;br&gt;
because of your love and faithfulness;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For you have glorified your Name *&lt;br&gt;
and your word above all things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I called, you answered me; *&lt;br&gt;
you increased my strength within me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	All the kings of the earth will praise you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
when they have heard the words of your mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will sing of the ways of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
that great is the glory of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Though the LORD be high, he cares for the lowly; *&lt;br&gt;
he perceives the haughty from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;&lt;br&gt;
your right hand shall save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The LORD will make good his purpose for me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, your love endures for ever;&lt;br&gt;
do not abandon the works of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-151-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 15:1-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&amp;ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&amp;ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.&amp;rdquo; Simon answered, &amp;ldquo;Master, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.&amp;rdquo; When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break. So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&amp;rsquo; knees, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!&amp;rdquo; For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.&amp;rdquo; When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Malachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord, See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight&amp;ndash; indeed, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he is like a refiner&amp;rsquo;s fire and like fullers&amp;rsquo; soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the LORD in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-84&#34;&gt;Psalm 84&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quam dilecta!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *&lt;br&gt;
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The sparrow has found her a house&lt;br&gt;
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *&lt;br&gt;
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,&lt;br&gt;
my King and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *&lt;br&gt;
they will always be praising you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *&lt;br&gt;
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *&lt;br&gt;
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will climb from height to height, *&lt;br&gt;
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Behold our defender, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
and look upon the face of your Anointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with integrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-214-18_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 2:14-18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since God&amp;rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-holy-gospel-_luke-222-40_&#34;&gt;The Holy Gospel: &lt;em&gt;Luke 2:22-40&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&amp;rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;&lt;br&gt;
for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,&lt;br&gt;
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child&amp;rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &amp;ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&amp;ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to me saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.&amp;rdquo; But the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not say, &amp;lsquo;I am only a boy&amp;rsquo;; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you, Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;br&gt;
In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; *&lt;br&gt;
let me never be ashamed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;br&gt;
In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *&lt;br&gt;
incline your ear to me and save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;br&gt;
Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my crag and my stronghold.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;br&gt;
Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;br&gt;
For you are my hope, O Lord GOD, *&lt;br&gt;
my confidence since I was young.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;br&gt;
I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;&lt;br&gt;
from my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb you have been my strength; *&lt;br&gt;
my praise shall be always of you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-131-13_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 13:1-13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus began to speak in the synagogue at Nazareth: &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo; All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They said, &amp;ldquo;Is not this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, &amp;lsquo;Doctor, cure yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will say, &amp;lsquo;Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.&#39;&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet&amp;rsquo;s hometown. But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.&amp;rdquo; When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage. They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff. But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul said to King Agrippa, &amp;ldquo;Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death. By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, &lt;code&gt;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.&#39; I asked, &lt;/code&gt;Who are you, Lord?&amp;rsquo; The Lord answered, `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you. I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles&amp;ndash; to whom I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance. For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin; for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days; but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord&amp;rsquo;s brother. In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ; they only heard it said, &amp;ldquo;The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.&amp;rdquo; And they glorified God because of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve, &amp;ldquo;See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;

In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Nehemiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people of Israel gathered together into the square before the Water Gate. They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had given to Israel. Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding. This was on the first day of the seventh month. He read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, &amp;ldquo;Amen, Amen,&amp;rdquo; lifting up their hands. Then they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. So they read from the book, from the law of God, with interpretation. They gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, &amp;ldquo;This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.&amp;rdquo; For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions of them to those for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to our LORD; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-19&#34;&gt;Psalm 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caeli enarrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *&lt;br&gt;
and the firmament shows his handiwork.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	One day tells its tale to another, *&lt;br&gt;
and one night imparts knowledge to another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Although they have no words or language, *&lt;br&gt;
and their voices are not heard,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it again; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The law of the LORD is perfect&lt;br&gt;
and revives the soul; *&lt;br&gt;
the testimony of the LORD is sure&lt;br&gt;
and gives wisdom to the innocent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The statutes of the LORD are just&lt;br&gt;
and rejoice the heart; *&lt;br&gt;
the commandment of the LORD is clear&lt;br&gt;
and gives light to the eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The fear of the LORD is clean&lt;br&gt;
and endures for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
the judgments of the LORD are true&lt;br&gt;
and righteous altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he offends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great offense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-1212-31a_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 12:12-31a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&amp;ndash;Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&amp;ndash;and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, &amp;ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,&amp;rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear would say, &amp;ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,&amp;rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, &amp;ldquo;I have no need of you,&amp;rdquo; nor again the head to the feet, &amp;ldquo;I have no need of you.&amp;rdquo; On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect; whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? But strive for the greater gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,&lt;br&gt;
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.&lt;br&gt;
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-2&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospel of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty Father, who inspired Simon Peter, first among the apostles, to confess Jesus as Messiah and Son of the living God: Keep your Church steadfast upon the rock of this faith, so that in unity and peace we may proclaim the one truth and follow the one Lord, our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &amp;ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead. This Jesus is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regit me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my shepherd; *&lt;br&gt;
I shall not be in want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	He makes me lie down in green pastures *&lt;br&gt;
and leads me beside still waters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He revives my soul *&lt;br&gt;
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,&lt;br&gt;
I shall fear no evil; *&lt;br&gt;
for you are with me;&lt;br&gt;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; *&lt;br&gt;
you have anointed my head with oil,&lt;br&gt;
and my cup is running over.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, *&lt;br&gt;
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an elder myself and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I exhort the elders among you to tend the flock of God that is in your charge, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion but willingly, as God would have you do it&amp;ndash; not for sordid gain but eagerly. Do not lord it over those in your charge, but be examples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, &amp;ldquo;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&amp;rdquo; And they said, &amp;ldquo;Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&amp;rdquo; Simon Peter answered, &amp;ldquo;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ is the light of the world: Grant that your people, illumined by your Word and Sacraments, may shine with the radiance of Christ’s glory, that he may be known, worshiped, and obeyed to the ends of the earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not rest,&lt;br&gt;
until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.&lt;br&gt;
The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.&lt;br&gt;
You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.&lt;br&gt;
You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate;&lt;br&gt;
but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.&lt;br&gt;
For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you,&lt;br&gt;
and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-365-10&#34;&gt;Psalm 36:5-10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dixit injustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5  Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, *&lt;br&gt;
and your faithfulness to the clouds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,&lt;br&gt;
your justice like the great deep; *&lt;br&gt;
you save both man and beast, O LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 How priceless is your love, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *&lt;br&gt;
you give them drink from the river of your delights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 For with you is the well of life, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your light we see light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *&lt;br&gt;
and your favor to those who are true of heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-121-11_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;1 Corinthians 12:1-11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak. Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says &amp;ldquo;Let Jesus be cursed!&amp;rdquo; and no one can say &amp;ldquo;Jesus is Lord&amp;rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;They have no wine.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.&amp;rdquo; His mother said to the servants, &amp;ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&amp;rdquo; Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Fill the jars with water.&amp;rdquo; And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.&amp;rdquo; So they took it. When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.&amp;rdquo; Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;
that we may delight in your will,&lt;br&gt;
and walk in your ways,&lt;br&gt;
to the glory of your Name. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanctus&#34;&gt;Sanctus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan proclaimed him your beloved Son and anointed him with the Holy Spirit: Grant that all who are baptized into his Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly confess him as Lord and Savior; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD, he who created you, O Jacob,&lt;br&gt;
he who formed you, O Israel:&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.&lt;br&gt;
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;&lt;br&gt;
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.&lt;br&gt;
For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.&lt;br&gt;
I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.&lt;br&gt;
Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you,&lt;br&gt;
I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life.&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;&lt;br&gt;
I will say to the north, &amp;ldquo;Give them up,&amp;rdquo; and to the south, &amp;ldquo;Do not withhold;&lt;br&gt;
bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Ascribe to the LORD, you gods, *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;&lt;br&gt;
the God of glory thunders; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is upon the mighty waters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The voice of the LORD is a powerful voice; *&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD is a voice of splendor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedar trees; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, *&lt;br&gt;
and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire;&lt;br&gt;
the voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	The voice of the LORD makes the oak trees writhe *&lt;br&gt;
and strips the forests bare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. The two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-holy-gospel-_luke-315-1721-22_&#34;&gt;The Holy Gospel: &lt;em&gt;Luke 3:15-17,21-22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &amp;ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God, by the leading of a star you manifested your only Son to the peoples of the earth: Lead us, who know you now by faith, to your presence, where we may see your glory face to face; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.&lt;br&gt;
For darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples;&lt;br&gt;
but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will appear over you.&lt;br&gt;
Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.&lt;br&gt;
Lift up your eyes and look around; they all gather together, they come to you;&lt;br&gt;
your sons shall come from far away, and your daughters shall be carried on their nurses&amp;rsquo; arms.&lt;br&gt;
Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and rejoice,&lt;br&gt;
because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.&lt;br&gt;
A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come.&lt;br&gt;
They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praise of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 That the mountains may bring prosperity to the people, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 All kings shall bow down before him, *&lt;br&gt;

and the oppressed who has no helper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 He shall have pity on the lowly and poor; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall preserve the lives of the needy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, *&lt;br&gt;
and dear shall their blood be in his sight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&amp;ndash; for surely you have already heard of the commission of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me by the working of his power. Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, &amp;ldquo;Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, &amp;ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;&lt;br&gt;
for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.&lt;/p&gt;

Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;

With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations;&lt;br&gt;
proclaim, give praise, and say, &amp;ldquo;Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,&lt;br&gt;
among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.&lt;br&gt;
With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back,&lt;br&gt;
I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;&lt;br&gt;
for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.&lt;br&gt;
Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away;&lt;br&gt;
say, &amp;ldquo;He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.&lt;br&gt;
They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd;&lt;br&gt;
their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.&lt;br&gt;
Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry.&lt;br&gt;
I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.&lt;br&gt;
I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-84&#34;&gt;Psalm 84&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quam dilecta!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *&lt;br&gt;
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The sparrow has found her a house&lt;br&gt;
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *&lt;br&gt;
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,&lt;br&gt;
my King and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *&lt;br&gt;
they will always be praising you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *&lt;br&gt;
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *&lt;br&gt;
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will climb from height to height, *&lt;br&gt;
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Behold our defender, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
and look upon the face of your Anointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with integrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wise men had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&amp;rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &amp;ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child&amp;rsquo;s life are dead.&amp;rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee. There he made his home in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;He will be called a Nazorean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LORD spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the Israelites: You shall say to them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	O LORD our Governor, *&lt;br&gt;
how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Out of the mouths of infants and children *&lt;br&gt;
your majesty is praised above the heavens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
to quell the enemy and the avenger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, *&lt;br&gt;
the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	What is man that you should be mindful of him? *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man that you should seek him out?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	You have made him but little lower than the angels; *&lt;br&gt;
you adorn him with glory and honor;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	You give him mastery over the works of your hands; *&lt;br&gt;
you put all things under his feet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	All sheep and oxen, *&lt;br&gt;
even the wild beasts of the field,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, *&lt;br&gt;
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the sea.&lt;br&gt;

how exalted is your Name in all the world!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for there is a reward for your work,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says the LORD: they shall come back from the land of the enemy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is hope for your future,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then would they have swallowed us up alive *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	Then would the waters have overwhelmed us *&lt;br&gt;
and the torrent gone over us;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

he has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the one who was seated on the throne said, “See, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.” Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life. Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be my children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the wise men had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&amp;rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &amp;ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:&lt;/p&gt;

he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;

And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moses said to God, &amp;ldquo;Show me your glory, I pray.&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, `The LORD&amp;rsquo;; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.&amp;rdquo; And the LORD continued, &amp;ldquo;See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonum est confiteri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and to sing praises to your Name, O Most High;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	To tell of your loving-kindness early in the morning *&lt;br&gt;
and of your faithfulness in the night season;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	On the psaltery, and on the lyre, *&lt;br&gt;
and to the melody of the harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For you have made me glad by your acts, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
and I shout for joy because of the works of your hands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	LORD, how great are your works! *&lt;br&gt;
your thoughts are very deep.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The dullard does not know,&lt;br&gt;
nor does the fool understand, *&lt;br&gt;
that though the wicked grow like weeds,&lt;br&gt;
and all the workers of iniquity flourish,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	They flourish only to be destroyed for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, are exalted for evermore.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	For lo, your enemies, O LORD,&lt;br&gt;
lo, your enemies shall perish, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	But my horn you have exalted like the horns of wild bulls; *&lt;br&gt;
I am anointed with fresh oil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	My eyes also gloat over my enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
and my ears rejoice to hear the doom of the wicked who rise up against me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, *&lt;br&gt;
and shall spread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Those who are planted in the house of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
shall flourish in the courts of our God;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They shall still bear fruit in old age; *&lt;br&gt;
they shall be green and succulent;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	That they may show how upright the LORD is, *&lt;br&gt;
my Rock, in whom there is no fault.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life&amp;ndash; this life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us&amp;ndash; we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true; but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; he was the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?&amp;rdquo; When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Lord, what about him?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!&amp;rdquo; So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, &amp;ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the LORD: Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD; speak to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word. It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their evil doings. You shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently&amp;ndash; though you have not heeded&amp;ndash; then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, &amp;ldquo;You shall die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, `This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, &amp;ldquo;It is the LORD who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against you. But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-31&#34;&gt;Psalm 31&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In te, Domine, speravi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;&lt;br&gt;
let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Into your hands I commend my spirit, *&lt;br&gt;
for you have redeemed me,&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, O God of truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *&lt;br&gt;
and I put my trust in the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *&lt;br&gt;
for you have seen my affliction;&lt;br&gt;
you know my distress.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *&lt;br&gt;
you have set my feet in an open place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For my life is wasted with grief,&lt;br&gt;
and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors,&lt;br&gt;
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *&lt;br&gt;
when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;&lt;br&gt;
fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *&lt;br&gt;
rather, let the wicked be put to shame;&lt;br&gt;
let them be silent in the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
haughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	How great is your goodness, O LORD!&lt;br&gt;
which you have laid up for those who fear you; *&lt;br&gt;
which you have done in the sight of all&lt;br&gt;
for those who put their trust in you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who slander them; *&lt;br&gt;
you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Blessed be the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged city.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Yet I said in my alarm,&lt;br&gt;
I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty&lt;br&gt;
when I cried out to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD protects the faithful,&lt;br&gt;
but repays to the full those who act haughtily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	Be strong and let your heart take courage, *&lt;br&gt;
all you who wait for the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and others of those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated some men to say, &amp;ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&amp;rdquo; They stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes; then they suddenly confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council. They set up false witnesses who said, &amp;ldquo;This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed on to us.&amp;rdquo; And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are these things so?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Stephen replied: &amp;ldquo;Brothers and fathers, listen to me. You are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do. Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers. You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen. But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. &amp;ldquo;Look,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&amp;rdquo; But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, &amp;ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&amp;rdquo; Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Therefore I send you prophets, sages, and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly I tell you, all this will come upon this generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you, desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, `Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;

to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you have poured upon us the new light of your incarnate Word: Grant that this light, enkindled in our hearts, may shine forth in our lives; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&lt;br&gt;
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;br&gt;
For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not rest,&lt;br&gt;
until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.&lt;br&gt;
The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.&lt;br&gt;
You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-147&#34;&gt;Psalm 147&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laudate Dominum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Hallelujah!&lt;br&gt;
How good it is to sing praises to our God! *&lt;br&gt;
how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
he gathers the exiles of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He heals the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;
and binds up their wounds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	He counts the number of the stars *&lt;br&gt;
and calls them all by their names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Great is our LORD and mighty in power; *&lt;br&gt;
there is no limit to his wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The LORD lifts up the lowly, *&lt;br&gt;
but casts the wicked to the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *&lt;br&gt;
make music to our God upon the harp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	He covers the heavens with clouds *&lt;br&gt;
and prepares rain for the earth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *&lt;br&gt;
and green plants to serve mankind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He provides food for flocks and herds *&lt;br&gt;
and for the young ravens when they cry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *&lt;br&gt;
he has no pleasure in the strength of a man;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
in those who await his gracious favor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
praise your God, O Zion;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; *&lt;br&gt;
he has blessed your children within you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	He has established peace on your borders; *&lt;br&gt;
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	He sends out his command to the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his word runs very swiftly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	He gives snow like wool; *&lt;br&gt;
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; *&lt;br&gt;
who can stand against his cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *&lt;br&gt;
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He declares his word to Jacob, *&lt;br&gt;
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	He has not done so to any other nation; *&lt;br&gt;
to them he has not revealed his judgments.&lt;br&gt;
Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_galatians-323-25-44-7_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Galatians 3:23-25; 4:4-7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth. (John testified to him and cried out, &amp;ldquo;This was he of whom I said, &amp;lsquo;He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.&#39;&amp;quot;) From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father&amp;rsquo;s heart, who has made him known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;&lt;br&gt;
those who lived in a land of deep darkness&amp;ndash; on them light has shined.&lt;br&gt;
You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy;&lt;br&gt;
they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as people exult when dividing plunder.&lt;br&gt;
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;br&gt;
For all the boots of the tramping warriors and all the garments rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;br&gt;
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us;&lt;br&gt;
authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named&lt;br&gt;
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&lt;br&gt;
His authority shall grow continually, and there shall be endless peace&lt;br&gt;
for the throne of David and his kingdom. He will establish and uphold it&lt;br&gt;
with justice and with righteousness from this time onward and forevermore.&lt;br&gt;
The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.&lt;/p&gt;

sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Declare his glory among the nations *&lt;br&gt;
and his wonders among all peoples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *&lt;br&gt;
he is more to be feared than all gods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *&lt;br&gt;
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *&lt;br&gt;
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Ascribe to the LORD the honor due his Name; *&lt;br&gt;
bring offerings and come into his courts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; *&lt;br&gt;
let the whole earth tremble before him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Tell it out among the nations: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is King! *&lt;br&gt;
he has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;&lt;br&gt;
he will judge the peoples with equity.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;&lt;br&gt;
let the sea thunder and all that is in it; *&lt;br&gt;
let the field be joyful and all that is therein.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy&lt;br&gt;
before the LORD when he comes, *&lt;br&gt;
when he comes to judge the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	He will judge the world with righteousness *&lt;br&gt;
and the peoples with his truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Titus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&amp;ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted sentinels;&lt;br&gt;
all day and all night they shall never be silent.&lt;br&gt;
You who remind the LORD, take no rest,&lt;br&gt;
and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it renowned throughout the earth.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm:&lt;br&gt;
I will not again give your grain to be food for your enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and foreigners shall not drink the wine for which you have labored;&lt;br&gt;
but those who garner it shall eat it and praise the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
and those who gather it shall drink it in my holy courts.&lt;br&gt;
Go through, go through the gates, prepare the way for the people;&lt;br&gt;
build up, build up the highway, clear it of stones, lift up an ensign over the peoples.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth:&lt;br&gt;
Say to daughter Zion, &amp;ldquo;See, your salvation comes;&lt;br&gt;
his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
They shall be called, &amp;ldquo;The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD&amp;rdquo;;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be called, &amp;ldquo;Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dominus regnavit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is King;&lt;br&gt;
let the earth rejoice; *&lt;br&gt;
let the multitude of the isles be glad.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Clouds and darkness are round about him, *&lt;br&gt;
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	A fire goes before him *&lt;br&gt;
and burns up his enemies on every side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	His lightnings light up the world; *&lt;br&gt;
the earth sees it and is afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	The heavens declare his righteousness, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the peoples see his glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Confounded be all who worship carved images&lt;br&gt;
and delight in false gods! *&lt;br&gt;
Bow down before him, all you gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *&lt;br&gt;
because of your judgments, O LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For you are the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
most high over all the earth; *&lt;br&gt;
you are exalted far above all gods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	The LORD loves those who hate evil; *&lt;br&gt;
he preserves the lives of his saints&lt;br&gt;
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Light has sprung up for the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
and give thanks to his holy Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of any works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy, through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. This Spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&amp;ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.&lt;/p&gt;

For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace,&lt;br&gt;
who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, &amp;ldquo;Your God reigns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices, together they sing for joy;&lt;br&gt;
for in plain sight they see the return of the LORD to Zion.&lt;br&gt;
Break forth together into singing, you ruins of Jerusalem;&lt;br&gt;
for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations;&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&amp;rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For to which of the angels did God ever say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let all God&amp;rsquo;s angels worship him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the angels he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the Son he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;&lt;br&gt;
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;&lt;br&gt;
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.&lt;br&gt;
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;

He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-2&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-3&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gifts of God for the People of God. Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everliving God, who strengthened your apostle Thomas with firm and certain faith in your Son’s resurrection: Grant us so perfectly and without doubt to believe in Jesus Christ, our Lord and our God, that our faith may never be found wanting in your sight; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Habakkuk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;&lt;br&gt;
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.&lt;br&gt;
Then the LORD answered me and said:&lt;br&gt;
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.&lt;br&gt;
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.&lt;br&gt;
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.&lt;br&gt;
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-126&#34;&gt;Psalm 126&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In convertendo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *&lt;br&gt;
then were we like those who dream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *&lt;br&gt;
and our tongue with shouts of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then they said among the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The LORD has done great things for us, *&lt;br&gt;
and we are glad indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
like the watercourses of the Negev.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Those who sowed with tears *&lt;br&gt;
will reap with songs of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *&lt;br&gt;
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-1035-111_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 10:35-11:1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. For yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“in a very little while,&lt;br&gt;
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;&lt;br&gt;
but my righteous one will live by faith.&lt;br&gt;
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Lord in your mercy” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Hear our prayer.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on us and forgive us;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,&lt;br&gt;
heaven and earth are full of your glory.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The Fourth Sunday of Advent</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, third, and fourth candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, the third candle is JOY, and the fourth candle is LOVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. (John 13:34)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving God, your mercy and compassion endure forever. Open our hearts, that we may receive your love; and following the example of your Son, spread that love to a love-starved world. Through Jesus Christ, who loved us to the end. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-7-8-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 7-8) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.sharedprayers.net/images/music/ocome-compact.png&#34; alt=&#34;Veni, veni, Emmanuel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Desire of nations, bind in one the hearts of all mankind;&lt;br&gt;
bid Thou our sad divisions cease, and be Thyself our King of Peace.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And also with you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purify our conscience, Almighty God, by your daily visitation, that your Son Jesus Christ, at his coming, may find in us a mansion prepared for himself; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Micah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah,&lt;br&gt;
from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel,&lt;br&gt;
whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth;&lt;br&gt;
then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.&lt;br&gt;
And they shall live secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
and he shall be the one of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expectans, expectavi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From this day all generations will call me blessed: *&lt;br&gt;
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has mercy on those who fear him *&lt;br&gt;
in every generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has shown the strength of his arm, *&lt;br&gt;
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *&lt;br&gt;
and has lifted up the lowly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;
and the rich he has sent away empty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The promise he made to our fathers, *&lt;br&gt;
to Abraham and his children for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-second-lesson-_hebrews-105-10_&#34;&gt;The Second Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Hebrews 10:5-10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;&lt;br&gt;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.&lt;br&gt;
Then I said, &amp;lsquo;See, God, I have come to do your will, O God&amp;rsquo; (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said above, &amp;ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&amp;rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &amp;ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&amp;rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&amp;rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-3&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-people-stand-as-able&#34;&gt;The people stand as able.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-holy-gospel-_luke-139-4546-55_&#34;&gt;The Holy Gospel: &lt;em&gt;Luke 1:39-45,(46-55)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke 1:39-45,(46-55).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;deacon-1&#34;&gt;Deacon:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth heard Mary&amp;rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And Mary said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;br&gt;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;br&gt;
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&lt;br&gt;
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&lt;br&gt;
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&lt;br&gt;
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-prayers-of-the-people&#34;&gt;The Prayers of the People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Come, O Lord, and save us.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most merciful God,&lt;br&gt;
we confess that we have sinned against you&lt;br&gt;
in thought, word, and deed,&lt;br&gt;
by what we have done,&lt;br&gt;
and by what we have left undone.&lt;br&gt;
We have not loved you with our whole heart;&lt;br&gt;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.&lt;br&gt;
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-9&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is right to give God thanks and praise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;a-proper-preface-may-be-used-here&#34;&gt;A Proper Preface may be used here.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMEN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-11&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-3&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gifts of God for the People of God. Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-receive-the-gift-of-god&#34;&gt;We Receive the Gift of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving Communion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).&lt;/em&gt; (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.&lt;/em&gt; (BCP, 457)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-for-spiritual-communion&#34;&gt;Prayer for Spiritual Communion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All are welcome to receive at Christ&amp;rsquo;s table. If you would prefer to receive a verbal blessing instead of communion, cross your arms over your chest to indicate this.&lt;/h5&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first, second, and third candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE, and the third candle is JOY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. (Isaiah 55:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracious God, you came to us in human flesh and you abide with us in the Holy Spirit. Fill us with your joy, and help us shine as a light to the world. Through Jesus Christ, who makes our joy complete. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-5-6-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 5-6) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, thou Key of David, come, and open wide our heavenly home;&lt;br&gt;
make safe the way that leads on high, and close the path to misery.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Day-spring from on high and cheer us by thy drawing nigh;&lt;br&gt;
disperse the gloomy clouds of night, and death&amp;rsquo;s dark shadow put to flight.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-1&#34;&gt;Officiant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stir up your power, O Lord, and with great might come among us; and, because we are sorely hindered by our sins, let your bountiful grace and mercy speedily help and deliver us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and glory, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Zephaniah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel!&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies.&lt;br&gt;
The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more.&lt;br&gt;
On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory;&lt;br&gt;
he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love;&lt;br&gt;
he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.&lt;br&gt;
I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.&lt;br&gt;
I will deal with all your oppressors at that time.&lt;br&gt;
And I will save the lame and gather the outcast,&lt;br&gt;
and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.&lt;br&gt;
At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you;&lt;br&gt;
for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth,&lt;br&gt;
when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;canticle-9&#34;&gt;Canticle 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely, it is God who saves me; *&lt;br&gt;
I will trust in him and not be afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will be my Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, &amp;ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, &amp;lsquo;We have Abraham as our ancestor&amp;rsquo;; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the crowds asked him, &amp;ldquo;What then should we do?&amp;rdquo; In reply he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.&amp;rdquo; Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, what should we do?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.&amp;rdquo; Soldiers also asked him, &amp;ldquo;And we, what should we do?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &amp;ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in one God,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;the Father, the Almighty,&lt;br&gt;
maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;
We look for the resurrection of the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the response to the prompt, &amp;ldquo;Let us pray” is, &lt;strong&gt;“Come, O Lord, and save us.”&lt;/strong&gt; The final verse and response, as we “offer ourselves and one another to the living God through Christ,” is &lt;strong&gt;“To you, O Lord.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna in the highest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-1&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Celebrant and &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We remember his death,&lt;br&gt;
We proclaim his resurrection,&lt;br&gt;
We await his coming in glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-celebrant-continues-2&#34;&gt;The Celebrant continues:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;celebrant-3&#34;&gt;Celebrant:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-10&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;officiant-and-people-1&#34;&gt;Officiant and &lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Father, &lt;strong&gt;who art in heaven,&lt;br&gt;
hallowed be thy Name,&lt;br&gt;
thy kingdom come,&lt;br&gt;
thy will be done,&lt;br&gt;
on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;presider-3&#34;&gt;Presider:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gifts of God for the People of God. Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-receive-the-gift-of-god&#34;&gt;We Receive the Gift of God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving Communion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).&lt;/em&gt; (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.&lt;/em&gt; (BCP, 457)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-for-spiritual-communion&#34;&gt;Prayer for Spiritual Communion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first and second candles of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE, the second candle is PEACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. (Colossians 3:15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, you offer rest for our hearts, and peace for our souls. Give us grace to seek peace in our lives, peace in this community, and peace in the world. Through Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-3-4-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 3-4) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, thou Lord of might, who to Thy tribes on Sinai&amp;rsquo;s height&lt;br&gt;
in ancient times didst give the law, in cloud and majesty and awe.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, thou Branch of Jesse&amp;rsquo;s tree, free them from Satan&amp;rsquo;s tyranny&lt;br&gt;
that trust thy mighty power save, and give them victory o&amp;rsquo;er the grave.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take off the garment of your sorrow and affliction, O Jerusalem, and put on forever the beauty of the glory from God.&lt;br&gt;
Put on the robe of the righteousness that comes from God; put on your head the diadem of the glory of the Everlasting;&lt;br&gt;
for God will show your splendor everywhere under heaven.&lt;br&gt;
For God will give you evermore the name, &amp;ldquo;Righteous Peace, Godly Glory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Arise, O Jerusalem, stand upon the height; look toward the east,&lt;br&gt;
and see your children gathered from west and east at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God has remembered them.&lt;br&gt;
For they went out from you on foot, led away by their enemies;&lt;br&gt;
but God will bring them back to you, carried in glory, as on a royal throne.&lt;br&gt;
For God has ordered that every high mountain and the everlasting hills be made low and the valleys filled up, to make level ground, so that Israel may walk safely in the glory of God.&lt;br&gt;
The woods and every fragrant tree have shaded Israel at God&amp;rsquo;s command.&lt;br&gt;
For God will lead Israel with joy, in the light of his glory, with the mercy and righteousness that come from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *&lt;br&gt;
he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight&lt;br&gt;
all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To give his people knowledge of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In the tender compassion of our God *&lt;br&gt;
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thank my God every time I remember you, constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you, because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now. I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God&amp;rsquo;s grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless, having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The voice of one crying out in the wilderness:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;br&gt;
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low,&lt;br&gt;
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth;&lt;br&gt;
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

maker of heaven and earth,&lt;br&gt;
of all that is, seen and unseen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,&lt;br&gt;
the only Son of God,&lt;br&gt;
eternally begotten of the Father,&lt;br&gt;
God from God,&lt;br&gt;
Light from Light, true God from true God,&lt;br&gt;
begotten, not made,&lt;br&gt;
of one Being with the Father.&lt;br&gt;
Through him all things were made.&lt;br&gt;
For us and for our salvation&lt;br&gt;
he came down from heaven:&lt;br&gt;
by the power of the Holy Spirit&lt;br&gt;
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,&lt;br&gt;
and was made man.&lt;br&gt;
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;&lt;br&gt;
he suffered death and was buried.&lt;br&gt;
On the third day he rose again&lt;br&gt;
in accordance with the Scriptures;&lt;br&gt;
he ascended into heaven&lt;br&gt;
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.&lt;br&gt;
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,&lt;br&gt;
and his kingdom will have no end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,&lt;br&gt;
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.&lt;br&gt;
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.&lt;br&gt;
He has spoken through the Prophets.&lt;br&gt;
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.&lt;br&gt;
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.&lt;br&gt;

and the life of the world to come. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving Communion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).&lt;/em&gt; (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.&lt;/em&gt; (BCP, 457)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_jeremiah-3314-16_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Jeremiah 33:14-16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-1&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;psalm-251-9&#34;&gt;Psalm 25:1-9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad te, Domine, levavi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul;&lt;br&gt;
my God, I put my trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
let me not be humiliated,&lt;br&gt;
nor let my enemies triumph over me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Let none who look to you be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
let the treacherous be disappointed in their schemes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Show me your ways, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and teach me your paths.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 Lead me in your truth and teach me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are the God of my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
in you have I trusted all the day long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Remember, O LORD, your compassion and love, *&lt;br&gt;
for they are from everlasting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Remember not the sins of my youth and my transgressions; *&lt;br&gt;
remember me according to your love&lt;br&gt;
and for the sake of your goodness, O LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Gracious and upright is the LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
therefore he teaches sinners in his way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 He guides the humble in doing right *&lt;br&gt;
and teaches his way to the lowly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 All the paths of the LORD are love and faithfulness *&lt;br&gt;
to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-2&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the Thessalonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we abound in love for you. And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-4&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see &amp;lsquo;the Son of Man coming in a cloud&amp;rsquo; with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he told them a parable: &amp;ldquo;Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-lesson-_baruch-51-9_&#34;&gt;The First Lesson: &lt;em&gt;Baruch 5:1-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-6&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Baruch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take off the garment of your sorrow and affliction, O Jerusalem, and put on forever the beauty of the glory from God.&lt;br&gt;
Put on the robe of the righteousness that comes from God; put on your head the diadem of the glory of the Everlasting;&lt;br&gt;
for God will show your splendor everywhere under heaven.&lt;br&gt;
For God will give you evermore the name, &amp;ldquo;Righteous Peace, Godly Glory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Arise, O Jerusalem, stand upon the height; look toward the east,&lt;br&gt;
and see your children gathered from west and east at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God has remembered them.&lt;br&gt;
For they went out from you on foot, led away by their enemies;&lt;br&gt;
but God will bring them back to you, carried in glory, as on a royal throne.&lt;br&gt;
For God has ordered that every high mountain and the everlasting hills be made low and the valleys filled up, to make level ground, so that Israel may walk safely in the glory of God.&lt;br&gt;
The woods and every fragrant tree have shaded Israel at God&amp;rsquo;s command.&lt;br&gt;
For God will lead Israel with joy, in the light of his glory, with the mercy and righteousness that come from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-7&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;people-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks be to God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;canticle-4-or-16&#34;&gt;Canticle 4 or 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *&lt;br&gt;
he has come to his people and set them free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *&lt;br&gt;
born of the house of his servant David.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Through his holy prophets he promised of old,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that he would save us from our enemies, *&lt;br&gt;
from the hands of all who hate us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He promised to show mercy to our fathers *&lt;br&gt;
and to remember his holy covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *&lt;br&gt;
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Free to worship him without fear, *&lt;br&gt;
holy and righteous in his sight&lt;br&gt;
all the days of our life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *&lt;br&gt;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To give his people knowledge of salvation *&lt;br&gt;
by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In the tender compassion of our God *&lt;br&gt;
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *&lt;br&gt;
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *&lt;br&gt;
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-8&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thank my God every time I remember you, constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you, because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now. I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God&amp;rsquo;s grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless, having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The voice of one crying out in the wilderness:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&lt;br&gt;
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low,&lt;br&gt;
and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth;&lt;br&gt;
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel!&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies.&lt;br&gt;
The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more.&lt;br&gt;
On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory;&lt;br&gt;
he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love;&lt;br&gt;
he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.&lt;br&gt;
I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.&lt;br&gt;
I will deal with all your oppressors at that time.&lt;br&gt;
And I will save the lame and gather the outcast,&lt;br&gt;
and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.&lt;br&gt;
At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you;&lt;br&gt;
for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth,&lt;br&gt;
when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *&lt;br&gt;
and he will be my Savior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *&lt;br&gt;
from the springs of salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And on that day you shall say, *&lt;br&gt;
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make his deeds known among the peoples; *&lt;br&gt;
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *&lt;br&gt;
and this is known in all the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-16&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, &amp;ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, &amp;lsquo;We have Abraham as our ancestor&amp;rsquo;; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the crowds asked him, &amp;ldquo;What then should we do?&amp;rdquo; In reply he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.&amp;rdquo; Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, what should we do?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.&amp;rdquo; Soldiers also asked him, &amp;ldquo;And we, what should we do?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &amp;ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth;&lt;br&gt;
then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
And he shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;He has filled the hungry with good things, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Christ came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;&lt;br&gt;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.&lt;br&gt;
Then I said, &amp;lsquo;See, God, I have come to do your will, O God&amp;rsquo; (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said above, &amp;ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&amp;rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &amp;ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&amp;rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&amp;rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth heard Mary&amp;rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And Mary said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;br&gt;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;br&gt;
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&lt;br&gt;
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&lt;br&gt;
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&lt;br&gt;

For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.&lt;br&gt;
For all the boots of the tramping warriors and all the garments rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.&lt;br&gt;

authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; for see&amp;ndash; I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.&amp;rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.&amp;rdquo; So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.]&lt;/p&gt;

for he has done marvelous things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	With his right hand and his holy arm *&lt;br&gt;
has he won for himself the victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *&lt;br&gt;
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	With trumpets and the sound of the horn *&lt;br&gt;
shout with joy before the King, the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Let the sea make a noise and all that is in it, *&lt;br&gt;
the lands and those who dwell therein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Let the rivers clap their hands, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10	In righteousness shall he judge the world *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-38&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds. He is the reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s glory and the exact imprint of God&amp;rsquo;s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For to which of the angels did God ever say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will be his Father, and he will be my Son&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let all God&amp;rsquo;s angels worship him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the angels he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the Son he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;&lt;br&gt;
they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like clothing;&lt;br&gt;
like a cloak you will roll them up, and like clothing they will be changed.&lt;br&gt;
But you are the same, and your years will never end.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&amp;rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&lt;br&gt;
For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,&lt;br&gt;
so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.&lt;br&gt;
For Zion&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&amp;rsquo;s sake I will not rest,&lt;br&gt;
until her vindication shines out like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.&lt;br&gt;
The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory;&lt;br&gt;
and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will give.&lt;br&gt;
You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He heals the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;

and for the young ravens when they cry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
in those who await his gracious favor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;

who can stand against his cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *&lt;br&gt;
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He declares his word to Jacob, *&lt;br&gt;
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	He has not done so to any other nation; *&lt;br&gt;
to them he has not revealed his judgments.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &amp;ldquo;Abba! Father!&amp;rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.&lt;/p&gt;

The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God.

When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;

See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth,&lt;br&gt;
among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.&lt;br&gt;
With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back,&lt;br&gt;
I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble;&lt;br&gt;
for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.&lt;br&gt;
Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away;&lt;br&gt;
say, &amp;ldquo;He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.&lt;br&gt;
They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD,&lt;br&gt;
over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd;&lt;br&gt;
their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.&lt;br&gt;
Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry.&lt;br&gt;
I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.&lt;br&gt;
I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *&lt;br&gt;
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The sparrow has found her a house&lt;br&gt;
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *&lt;br&gt;
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,&lt;br&gt;
my King and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *&lt;br&gt;
they will always be praising you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *&lt;br&gt;
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *&lt;br&gt;
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will climb from height to height, *&lt;br&gt;
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Behold our defender, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
and look upon the face of your Anointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with integrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wise men had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&amp;rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &amp;ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child&amp;rsquo;s life are dead.&amp;rdquo; Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee. There he made his home in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;He will be called a Nazorean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&amp;ndash; for surely you have already heard of the commission of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God&amp;rsquo;s grace that was given me by the working of his power. Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, &amp;ldquo;Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, &amp;ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;&lt;br&gt;
for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.&amp;rdquo; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.&lt;/p&gt;

When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;&lt;br&gt;
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.&lt;br&gt;
For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.&lt;br&gt;
I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you.&lt;br&gt;
Because you are precious in my sight, and honored, and I love you,&lt;br&gt;
I give people in return for you, nations in exchange for your life.&lt;br&gt;
Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you;&lt;br&gt;
I will say to the north, &amp;ldquo;Give them up,&amp;rdquo; and to the south, &amp;ldquo;Do not withhold;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.

Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak. Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says &amp;ldquo;Let Jesus be cursed!&amp;rdquo; and no one can say &amp;ldquo;Jesus is Lord&amp;rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;They have no wine.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.&amp;rdquo; His mother said to the servants, &amp;ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&amp;rdquo; Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Fill the jars with water.&amp;rdquo; And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.&amp;rdquo; So they took it. When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.&amp;rdquo; Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the people of Israel gathered together into the square before the Water Gate. They told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had given to Israel. Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding. This was on the first day of the seventh month. He read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, &amp;ldquo;Amen, Amen,&amp;rdquo; lifting up their hands. Then they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. So they read from the book, from the law of God, with interpretation. They gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, &amp;ldquo;This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.&amp;rdquo; For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Go your way, eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions of them to those for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to our LORD; and do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *&lt;br&gt;
and their message to the ends of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *&lt;br&gt;
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;&lt;br&gt;
it rejoices like a champion to run its course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens&lt;br&gt;
and runs about to the end of it again; *&lt;br&gt;
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10	More to be desired are they than gold,&lt;br&gt;
more than much fine gold, *&lt;br&gt;
sweeter far than honey,&lt;br&gt;
than honey in the comb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *&lt;br&gt;
and in keeping them there is great reward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Who can tell how often he offends? *&lt;br&gt;
cleanse me from my secret faults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;&lt;br&gt;
let them not get dominion over me; *&lt;br&gt;
then shall I be whole and sound,&lt;br&gt;
and innocent of a great offense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart&lt;br&gt;
be acceptable in your sight, *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&amp;ndash;Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&amp;ndash;and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot would say, &amp;ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,&amp;rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear would say, &amp;ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,&amp;rdquo; that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, &amp;ldquo;I have no need of you,&amp;rdquo; nor again the head to the feet, &amp;ldquo;I have no need of you.&amp;rdquo; On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect; whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? But strive for the greater gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,&lt;br&gt;
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.&lt;br&gt;
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.&amp;rdquo; But the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not say, &amp;lsquo;I am only a boy&amp;rsquo;; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you, Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says the LORD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.&lt;/p&gt;

They said, &amp;ldquo;Is not this Joseph&amp;rsquo;s son?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, &amp;lsquo;Doctor, cure yourself!&amp;rsquo; And you will say, &amp;lsquo;Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.&#39;&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet&amp;rsquo;s hometown. But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.&amp;rdquo; When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage. They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff. But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. And I said: &amp;ldquo;Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: &amp;ldquo;Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.&amp;rdquo; Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &amp;ldquo;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&amp;rdquo; And I said, &amp;ldquo;Here am I; send me!&amp;rdquo; [And he said, &amp;ldquo;Go and say to this people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Keep listening, but do not comprehend;&lt;br&gt;
keep looking, but do not understand.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
Make the mind of this people dull, and stop their ears, and shut their eyes,&lt;br&gt;
so that they may not look with their eyes, and listen with their ears,&lt;br&gt;
and comprehend with their minds, and turn and be healed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;How long, O Lord?&amp;rdquo; And he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Until cities lie waste without inhabitant,&lt;br&gt;
and houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate;&lt;br&gt;
until the Lord sends everyone far away, and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.&lt;br&gt;
Even if a tenth part remain in it, it will be burned again,&lt;br&gt;
like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains standing when it is felled.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *&lt;br&gt;
before the gods I will sing your praise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	I will bow down toward your holy temple&lt;br&gt;
and praise your Name, *&lt;br&gt;
because of your love and faithfulness;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	For you have glorified your Name *&lt;br&gt;
and your word above all things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	When I called, you answered me; *&lt;br&gt;
you increased my strength within me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	All the kings of the earth will praise you, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
when they have heard the words of your mouth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will sing of the ways of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
that great is the glory of the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Though the LORD be high, he cares for the lowly; *&lt;br&gt;
he perceives the haughty from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me safe; *&lt;br&gt;
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;&lt;br&gt;
your right hand shall save me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	The LORD will make good his purpose for me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, your love endures for ever;&lt;br&gt;
do not abandon the works of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&amp;ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&amp;ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.&amp;rdquo; Simon answered, &amp;ldquo;Master, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.&amp;rdquo; When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break. So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&amp;rsquo; knees, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!&amp;rdquo; For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.&amp;rdquo; When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their strength, whose hearts turn away from the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief comes.&lt;br&gt;
They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.&lt;br&gt;
Blessed are those who trust in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream.&lt;br&gt;
It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green;&lt;br&gt;
in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit.&lt;br&gt;
The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse&amp;ndash; who can understand it?&lt;br&gt;
I the LORD test the mind and search the heart,&lt;br&gt;
to give to all according to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ&amp;ndash;whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have died in Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus came down with the twelve apostles and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all in the crowd were trying to touch him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph said to his brothers, &amp;ldquo;I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?&amp;rdquo; But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Joseph said to his brothers, &amp;ldquo;Come closer to me.&amp;rdquo; And they came closer. He said, &amp;ldquo;I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, &amp;lsquo;Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children&amp;rsquo;s children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide for you there&amp;ndash;since there are five more years of famine to come&amp;ndash;so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone will ask, &amp;ldquo;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?&amp;rdquo; Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus it is written, &amp;ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living being&amp;rdquo;; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness, not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside. But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside. Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since it is by God&amp;rsquo;s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&amp;rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, &amp;ldquo;This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!&amp;rdquo; When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. Just then a man from the crowd shouted, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son; he is my only child. Suddenly a spirit seizes him, and all at once he shrieks. It convulses him until he foams at the mouth; it mauls him and will scarcely leave him. I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You faithless and perverse generation, how much longer must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.&amp;rdquo; While he was coming, the demon dashed him to the ground in convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. And all were astounded at the greatness of God.]&lt;/p&gt;

Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,&lt;br&gt;
for the day of the Lord is coming, it is near—&lt;br&gt;

return to me with all your heart,&lt;br&gt;
with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;&lt;br&gt;
rend your hearts and not your clothing.&lt;br&gt;
Return to the Lord, your God,&lt;br&gt;
for he is gracious and merciful,&lt;br&gt;
slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love,&lt;br&gt;
and relents from punishing.&lt;br&gt;
Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	He made his ways known to Moses *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9	He will not always accuse us, *&lt;br&gt;
nor will he keep his anger for ever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, *&lt;br&gt;
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

so is his mercy great upon those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	As far as the east is from the west, *&lt;br&gt;
so far has he removed our sins from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	As a father cares for his children, *&lt;br&gt;
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he himself knows whereof we are made; *&lt;br&gt;
he remembers that we are but dust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and his kingship has dominion over all.&lt;br&gt;

you mighty ones who do his bidding, *&lt;br&gt;
and hearken to the voice of his word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
you ministers of his who do his will.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Bless the LORD, all you works of his,&lt;br&gt;
in all places of his dominion; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘At an acceptable time I have listened to you,&lt;br&gt;
and on a day of salvation I have helped you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are putting no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labours, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see—we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &amp;ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&amp;rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &amp;ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&amp;rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his baptism, Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished. The devil said to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;It is written, &amp;lsquo;One does not live by bread alone.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And the devil said to him, &amp;ldquo;To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;It is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.” But the word of the LORD came to him, “This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.” He brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” And he believed the LORD; and the LORD reckoned it to him as righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to him, “I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.” But he said, “O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?” He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	The LORD is my light and my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
whom then shall I fear? *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD is the strength of my life;&lt;br&gt;
of whom then shall I be afraid?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	When evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh, *&lt;br&gt;
it was they, my foes and my adversaries, who stumbled and fell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Though an army should encamp against me, *&lt;br&gt;
yet my heart shall not be afraid;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	And though war should rise up against me, *&lt;br&gt;
yet will I put my trust in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	One thing have I asked of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
one thing I seek; *&lt;br&gt;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days&lt;br&gt;
of my life;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	To behold the fair beauty of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
and to seek him in his temple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	For in the day of trouble he shall keep me safe in his shelter; *&lt;br&gt;
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling&lt;br&gt;
and set me high upon a rock.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Even now he lifts up my head *&lt;br&gt;
above my enemies round about me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation&lt;br&gt;
with sounds of great gladness; *&lt;br&gt;
I will sing and make music to the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Hearken to my voice, O LORD, when I call; *&lt;br&gt;
have mercy on me and answer me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	You speak in my heart and say, &amp;ldquo;Seek my face.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Your face, LORD, will I seek.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	Hide not your face from me, *&lt;br&gt;
nor turn away your servant in displeasure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	You have been my helper;&lt;br&gt;
cast me not away; *&lt;br&gt;
do not forsake me, O God of my salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	Though my father and my mother forsake me, *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD will sustain me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	Show me your way, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
lead me on a level path, because of my enemies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Deliver me not into the hand of my adversaries, *&lt;br&gt;
for false witnesses have risen up against me,&lt;br&gt;
and also those who speak malice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	What if I had not believed&lt;br&gt;
that I should see the goodness of the LORD *&lt;br&gt;
in the land of the living!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	O tarry and await the LORD&amp;rsquo;S pleasure;&lt;br&gt;
be strong, and he shall comfort your heart; *&lt;br&gt;
wait patiently for the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.&amp;rsquo; Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-132&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &amp;lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&amp;rsquo; and they ask me, &amp;lsquo;What is his name?&amp;rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&#39;” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &amp;lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 O God, you are my God; eagerly I seek you; *&lt;br&gt;
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,&lt;br&gt;
as in a barren and dry land where there is no water.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, &amp;ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.&amp;rdquo; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come. So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that very time there were some present who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. He asked them, &amp;ldquo;Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them&amp;ndash;do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he told this parable: &amp;ldquo;A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said to the gardener, &amp;lsquo;See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &amp;lsquo;Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal they kept the passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho. On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.&lt;/p&gt;

you surround me with shouts of deliverance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

who must be fitted with bit and bridle,&lt;br&gt;
or else they will not stay near you.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&lt;/p&gt;

The younger of them said to his father, &amp;lsquo;Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.&amp;rsquo; So he divided his property between them. A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, and there he squandered his property in dissolute living. When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs. He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he said, &amp;lsquo;How many of my father&amp;rsquo;s hired hands have bread enough and to spare, but here I am dying of hunger! I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, &amp;ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo; So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him. Then the son said to him, &amp;lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&amp;rsquo; But the father said to his slaves, &amp;lsquo;Quickly, bring out a robe&amp;ndash;the best one&amp;ndash;and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!&amp;rsquo; And they began to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on. He replied, &amp;lsquo;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has got him back safe and sound.&amp;rsquo; Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him. But he answered his father, &amp;lsquo;Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!&amp;rsquo; Then the father said to him, &amp;lsquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior;&lt;br&gt;
they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:&lt;br&gt;
Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.&lt;br&gt;
I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?&lt;br&gt;
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.&lt;br&gt;
The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches;&lt;br&gt;
for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert,&lt;br&gt;
to give drink to my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself&lt;br&gt;
so that they might declare my praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;&lt;br&gt;
I did not hide my face from insult and spitting.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord GOD helps me; therefore I have not been disgraced;&lt;br&gt;
therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near.&lt;br&gt;

Who are my adversaries? Let them confront me.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hour for the Passover meal came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, &amp;ldquo;Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&amp;rdquo; Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, &amp;ldquo;This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&amp;rdquo; And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, &amp;ldquo;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table. For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!&amp;rdquo; Then they began to ask one another, which one of them it could be who would do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said to them, &amp;ldquo;When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?&amp;rdquo; They said, &amp;ldquo;No, not a thing.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, `And he was counted among the lawless&amp;rsquo;; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; They said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;It is enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. When he reached the place, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo; Then he withdrew from them about a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, knelt down, and prayed, &amp;ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.&amp;rdquo; Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength. In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked, &amp;ldquo;Lord, should we strike with the sword?&amp;rdquo; Then one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;No more of this!&amp;rdquo; And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him, &amp;ldquo;Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest&amp;rsquo;s house. But Peter was following at a distance. When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said, &amp;ldquo;This man also was with him.&amp;rdquo; But he denied it, saying, &amp;ldquo;Woman, I do not know him.&amp;rdquo; A little later someone else, on seeing him, said, &amp;ldquo;You also are one of them.&amp;rdquo; But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Man, I am not!&amp;rdquo; Then about an hour later still another kept insisting, &amp;ldquo;Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.&amp;rdquo; But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;Man, I do not know what you are talking about!&amp;rdquo; At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, &amp;ldquo;Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.&amp;rdquo; And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, &amp;ldquo;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&amp;rdquo; They kept heaping many other insults on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council. They said, &amp;ldquo;If you are the Messiah, tell us.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I question you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&amp;rdquo; All of them asked, &amp;ldquo;Are you, then, the Son of God?&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am.&amp;rdquo; Then they said, &amp;ldquo;What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate. They began to accuse him, saying, &amp;ldquo;We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.&amp;rdquo; Then Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the king of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;You say so.&amp;rdquo; Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &amp;ldquo;I find no basis for an accusation against this man.&amp;rdquo; But they were insistent and said, &amp;ldquo;He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that he was under Herod&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign. He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate. That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people, and said to them, &amp;ldquo;You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death. I will therefore have him flogged and release him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they all shouted out together, &amp;ldquo;Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!&amp;rdquo; (This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.) Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again; but they kept shouting, &amp;ldquo;Crucify, crucify him!&amp;rdquo; A third time he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.&amp;rdquo; But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted. He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus. A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him. But Jesus turned to them and said, &amp;ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For the days are surely coming when they will say, &amp;lsquo;Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.&amp;rsquo; Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &amp;lsquo;Fall on us&amp;rsquo;; and to the hills, &amp;lsquo;Cover us.&amp;rsquo; For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, while the sun&amp;rsquo;s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, &amp;ldquo;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.&amp;rdquo; Having said this, he breathed his last. When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, &amp;ldquo;Certainly this man was innocent.&amp;rdquo; And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts. But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council, had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid. Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;&lt;br&gt;
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.&lt;br&gt;
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;&lt;br&gt;
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.&lt;br&gt;
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,&lt;br&gt;
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &amp;ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&amp;rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&amp;rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to me, O coastlands, pay attention, you peoples from far away!&lt;br&gt;
The LORD called me before I was born, while I was in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb he named me.&lt;br&gt;
He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me;&lt;br&gt;
he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away.&lt;br&gt;
And he said to me, &amp;ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
But I said, &amp;ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;&lt;br&gt;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
And now the LORD says, who formed me in the womb to be his servant,&lt;br&gt;
to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him,&lt;br&gt;
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God has become my strength&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
he says,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the survivors of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,&lt;br&gt;
to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kings shall see and stand up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,&lt;br&gt;
because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

come quickly to help me, O my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-164&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&amp;rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God&amp;rsquo;s weakness is stronger than human strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&amp;rdquo; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say&amp;ndash; `Father, save me from this hour&amp;rsquo;? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.&amp;rdquo; Then a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&amp;rdquo; The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, &amp;ldquo;An angel has spoken to him.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&amp;rdquo; He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&amp;rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&amp;ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&amp;ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&amp;rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&amp;rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &amp;ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&amp;rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had gone out, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&amp;ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, `Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, my servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.&lt;br&gt;
Just as there were many who were astonished at him &amp;ndash;so marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him;&lt;br&gt;
for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate.&lt;br&gt;
Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?&lt;br&gt;
For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground;&lt;br&gt;
he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&lt;br&gt;
He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity;&lt;br&gt;
and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.&lt;br&gt;
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases;&lt;br&gt;
yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.&lt;br&gt;
But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities;&lt;br&gt;
upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.&lt;br&gt;
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way,&lt;br&gt;
and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&lt;br&gt;
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth;&lt;br&gt;
like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
By a perversion of justice he was taken away. Who could have imagined his future?&lt;br&gt;
For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people.&lt;br&gt;
They made his grave with the wicked and his tomb with the rich,&lt;br&gt;
although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him with pain.&lt;br&gt;
When you make his life an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, and shall prolong his days;&lt;br&gt;
through him the will of the LORD shall prosper. Out of his anguish he shall see light;&lt;br&gt;
he shall find satisfaction through his knowledge. The righteous one, my servant, shall make many righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore I will allot him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;&lt;br&gt;
because he poured out himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;&lt;br&gt;
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *&lt;br&gt;
by night as well, but I find no rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3	Yet you are the Holy One, *&lt;br&gt;
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted, and you delivered them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *&lt;br&gt;
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *&lt;br&gt;
scorned by all and despised by the people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *&lt;br&gt;

let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *&lt;br&gt;
and kept me safe upon my mother&amp;rsquo;s breast.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *&lt;br&gt;
you were my God when I was still in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *&lt;br&gt;
and there is none to help.&lt;br&gt;

strong bulls of Bashan surround me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	They open wide their jaws at me, *&lt;br&gt;
like a ravening and a roaring lion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	I am poured out like water;&lt;br&gt;
all my bones are out of joint; *&lt;br&gt;
my heart within my breast is melting wax.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;&lt;br&gt;
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *&lt;br&gt;
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Packs of dogs close me in,&lt;br&gt;
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *&lt;br&gt;
they pierce my hands and my feet;&lt;br&gt;
I can count all my bones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	They stare and gloat over me; *&lt;br&gt;
they divide my garments among them;&lt;br&gt;
they cast lots for my clothing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Be not far away, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
you are my strength; hasten to help me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	Save me from the sword, *&lt;br&gt;
my life from the power of the dog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	Save me from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth, *&lt;br&gt;
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *&lt;br&gt;
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *&lt;br&gt;
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;&lt;br&gt;
all you of Jacob&amp;rsquo;s line, give glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;&lt;br&gt;
neither does he hide his face from them; *&lt;br&gt;
but when they cry to him he hears them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *&lt;br&gt;
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,&lt;br&gt;
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;

all who go down to the dust fall before him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit testifies saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord:&lt;br&gt;
I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he also adds,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh), and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;I am he.&amp;rdquo; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am he,&amp;rdquo; they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, &amp;ldquo;Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; And they said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken, &amp;ldquo;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&amp;rdquo; Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest&amp;rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave&amp;rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Put your sword back into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him. First they took him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in. The woman said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of this man&amp;rsquo;s disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; Now the slaves and the police had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &amp;ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&amp;rdquo; Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They asked him, &amp;ldquo;You are not also one of his disciples, are you?&amp;rdquo; He denied it and said, &amp;ldquo;I am not.&amp;rdquo; One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &amp;ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&amp;rdquo; Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the cock crowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate&amp;rsquo;s headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the Passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, &amp;ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.&amp;rdquo; The Jews replied, &amp;ldquo;We are not permitted to put anyone to death.&amp;rdquo; (This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;Do you ask this on your own, or did others tell you about me?&amp;rdquo; Pilate replied, &amp;ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;So you are a king?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is truth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &amp;ldquo;I find no case against him. But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&amp;rdquo; They shouted in reply, &amp;ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!&amp;rdquo; Now Barabbas was a bandit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe. They kept coming up to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&amp;rdquo; and striking him on the face. Pilate went out again and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Here is the man!&amp;rdquo; When the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted, &amp;ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&amp;rdquo; The Jews answered him, &amp;ldquo;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid than ever. He entered his headquarters again and asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered him, &amp;ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&amp;rdquo; From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, &amp;ldquo;If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat on the judge&amp;rsquo;s bench at a place called The Stone Pavement, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &amp;ldquo;Here is your King!&amp;rdquo; They cried out, &amp;ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; Pilate asked them, &amp;ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&amp;rdquo; The chief priests answered, &amp;ldquo;We have no king but the emperor.&amp;rdquo; Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they took Jesus; and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, &amp;ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo; Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &amp;ldquo;Do not write, &amp;lsquo;The King of the Jews,&amp;rsquo; but, &amp;lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Pilate answered, &amp;ldquo;What I have written I have written.&amp;rdquo; When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. So they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&amp;rdquo; This was to fulfill what the scripture says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what the soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&amp;rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &amp;ldquo;Woman, here is your son.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to the disciple, &amp;ldquo;Here is your mother.&amp;rdquo; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &amp;ldquo;I am thirsty.&amp;rdquo; A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &amp;ldquo;It is finished.&amp;rdquo; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out. (He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.) These things occurred so that the scripture might be fulfilled, &amp;ldquo;None of his bones shall be broken.&amp;rdquo; And again another passage of scripture says, &amp;ldquo;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission; so he came and removed his body. Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because it was the Jewish day of Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job said, &amp;ldquo;A mortal, born of woman, few of days and full of trouble, comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow and does not last.&lt;br&gt;
Do you fix your eyes on such a one? Do you bring me into judgment with you?&lt;br&gt;
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one can.&lt;br&gt;
Since their days are determined, and the number of their months is known to you, and you have appointed the bounds that they cannot pass,&lt;br&gt;
look away from them, and desist, that they may enjoy, like laborers, their days.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease.&lt;br&gt;
Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,&lt;br&gt;
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth branches like a young plant.&lt;br&gt;
But mortals die, and are laid low; humans expire, and where are they?&lt;br&gt;
As waters fail from a lake, and a river wastes away and dries up,&lt;br&gt;
so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused out of their sleep.&lt;br&gt;
Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!&lt;br&gt;
If mortals die, will they live again? All the days of my service I would wait until my release should come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s first epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same intention (for whoever has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin), so as to live for the rest of your earthly life no longer by human desires but by the will of God. You have already spent enough time in doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry. They are surprised that you no longer join them in the same excesses of dissipation, and so they blaspheme. But they will have to give an accounting to him who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, &amp;ldquo;Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, &lt;code&gt;After three days I will rise again.&#39; Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, &lt;/code&gt;He has been raised from the dead,&amp;rsquo; and the last deception would be worse than the first.&amp;rdquo; Pilate said to them, &amp;ldquo;You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.&amp;rdquo; So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-192&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so. God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.” So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For whoever has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in, they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them. The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.&amp;rdquo; Then they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles. But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter began to speak to Cornelius and the other Gentiles: &amp;ldquo;I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ&amp;ndash;he is Lord of all. That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died. For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth that had been on Jesus&amp;rsquo; head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples returned to their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose NAME was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&amp;rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&amp;rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the multitude, &amp;ldquo;Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know&amp;ndash; this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law. But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power. For David says concerning him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;&lt;br&gt;
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will live in hope.&lt;br&gt;
For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One experience corruption.&lt;br&gt;
You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Then Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers, telling them, &amp;ldquo;You must say, `His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&amp;rsquo; If this comes to the governor&amp;rsquo;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&amp;rdquo; So they took the money and did as they were directed.

For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to him.&amp;rdquo; And he testified with many other arguments and exhorted them, saying, &amp;ldquo;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&amp;rdquo; So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand persons were added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon. And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms. Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, &amp;ldquo;Look at us.&amp;rdquo; And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, &amp;ldquo;I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk.&amp;rdquo; And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on that same day, the first day of the week, two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?&amp;rdquo; They stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, &amp;ldquo;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?&amp;rdquo; He asked them, &amp;ldquo;What things?&amp;rdquo; They replied, &amp;ldquo;The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?&amp;rdquo; Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. But they urged him strongly, saying, &amp;ldquo;Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.&amp;rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, &amp;ldquo;Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?&amp;rdquo; That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. They were saying, &amp;ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!&amp;rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the lame man whom Peter and John had healed clung to them, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Portico, utterly astonished. When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, &amp;ldquo;You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him. But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you, and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer. Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus, who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets. Moses said, &lt;code&gt;The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you. And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.&#39; And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days. You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, &lt;/code&gt;And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&amp;rsquo; When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus stood among the disciples and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&amp;rdquo; And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Have you anything here to eat?&amp;rdquo; They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you&amp;ndash; that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them, much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead. So they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who heard the word believed; and they numbered about five thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. When they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, &amp;ldquo;By what power or by what name did you do this?&amp;rdquo; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &amp;ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead.

&lt;p&gt;Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am going fishing.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;We will go with you.&amp;rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&amp;rdquo; They answered him, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&amp;rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;It is the Lord!&amp;rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&amp;rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&amp;rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus. When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another. They said, ‘What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it. But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.’ So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered them, ‘Whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.’ After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shorter Ending of Mark[[And all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter. And afterwards Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. ]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Longer Ending of Mark[[Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping. But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it. After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. And he said to them, ‘Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation. And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it. ]]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the temple police had brought the apostles, they had them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them, saying, &amp;ldquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man&amp;rsquo;s blood on us.&amp;rdquo; But Peter and the apostles answered, &amp;ldquo;We must obey God rather than any human authority. The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &amp;ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&amp;rdquo; But he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &amp;ldquo;Peace be with you.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &amp;ldquo;Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.&amp;rdquo; Thomas answered him, &amp;ldquo;My Lord and my God!&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &amp;ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&amp;rdquo; He asked, &amp;ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&amp;rdquo; The reply came, &amp;ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&amp;rdquo; [The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &amp;ldquo;Ananias.&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&amp;rdquo; The Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&amp;rdquo; But Ananias answered, &amp;ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.&amp;rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel; I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&amp;rdquo; So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, &amp;ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &amp;ldquo;He is the Son of God.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7	While I felt secure, I said,&lt;br&gt;
I shall never be disturbed. *&lt;br&gt;
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as&lt;br&gt;
the mountains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Then you hid your face, *&lt;br&gt;
and I was filled with fear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	I cried to you, O LORD; *&lt;br&gt;
I pleaded with the Lord, saying,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	&amp;ldquo;What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *&lt;br&gt;
will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, be my helper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	You have turned my wailing into dancing; *&lt;br&gt;
you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am going fishing.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;We will go with you.&amp;rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&amp;rdquo; They answered him, &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&amp;rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;It is the Lord!&amp;rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&amp;rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&amp;rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Feed my lambs.&amp;rdquo; A second time he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Tend my sheep.&amp;rdquo; He said to him the third time, &amp;ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&amp;rdquo; Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, &amp;ldquo;Do you love me?&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.&amp;rdquo; (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, &amp;ldquo;Please come to us without delay.&amp;rdquo; So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, &amp;ldquo;Tabitha, get up.&amp;rdquo; Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from John’s Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, singing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom&lt;br&gt;
and thanksgiving and honor&lt;br&gt;
and power and might&lt;br&gt;
be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, &amp;ldquo;Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?&amp;rdquo; I said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, you are the one that knows.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to me, &amp;ldquo;These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.&lt;br&gt;
They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat;&lt;br&gt;
for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,&lt;br&gt;
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &amp;ldquo;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered, &amp;ldquo;I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father&amp;rsquo;s name testify to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father&amp;rsquo;s hand. The Father and I are one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?&amp;rdquo; Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying, &amp;ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. I also heard a voice saying to me, &lt;code&gt;Get up, Peter; kill and eat.&#39; But I replied, &lt;/code&gt;By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&amp;rsquo; But a second time the voice answered from heaven, &lt;code&gt;What God has made clean, you must not call profane.&#39; This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven. At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were. The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&#39;s house. He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, &lt;/code&gt;Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter; he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.&amp;rsquo; And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, `John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rsquo; If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?&amp;rdquo; When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, &amp;ldquo;Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set sail from Troas and took a straight course to Samothrace, the following day to Neapolis, and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city for some days. On the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had gathered there. A certain woman named Lydia, a worshiper of God, was listening to us; she was from the city of Thyatira and a dealer in purple cloth. The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, &amp;ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home.&amp;rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit the angel carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never be shut by day&amp;ndash; and there will be no night there. People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s book of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. &amp;ldquo;This,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;is what you have heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when they had come together, they asked him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them. They said, &amp;ldquo;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

You are witnesses of these things. And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them. While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy; and they were continually in the temple blessing God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Paul and Silas, we came to Philippi in Macedonia, a Roman colony, and, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling. While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, &amp;ldquo;These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.&amp;rdquo; She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &amp;ldquo;I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&amp;rdquo; And it came out that very hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, &amp;ldquo;These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe.&amp;rdquo; The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods. After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely. Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&amp;rsquo;s chains were unfastened. When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul shouted in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&amp;rdquo; The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them outside and said, &amp;ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&amp;rdquo; They answered, &amp;ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&amp;rdquo; They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay. He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.&lt;/p&gt;

The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become completely one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that those also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory, which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you; and these know that you have sent me. I made your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, &amp;ldquo;Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&amp;rdquo; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, &amp;ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&amp;rdquo; The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built. And the LORD said, &amp;ldquo;Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another&amp;rsquo;s speech.&amp;rdquo; So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

creatures both small and great.&lt;br&gt;
27	&lt;strong&gt;There move the ships,&lt;br&gt;
and there is that Leviathan, *&lt;br&gt;
which you have made for the sport of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;28	All of them look to you *&lt;br&gt;
to give them their food in due season.&lt;br&gt;
29	&lt;strong&gt;You give it to them; they gather it; *&lt;br&gt;
you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30	You hide your face, and they are terrified; *&lt;br&gt;
you take away their breath,&lt;br&gt;
and they die and return to their dust.&lt;br&gt;
31	&lt;strong&gt;You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; *&lt;br&gt;
and so you renew the face of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32	May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; *&lt;br&gt;
may the LORD rejoice in all his works.&lt;br&gt;
33	&lt;strong&gt;He looks at the earth and it trembles; *&lt;br&gt;
he touches the mountains and they smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;34	I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; *&lt;br&gt;

I will rejoice in the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption. When we cry, &amp;ldquo;Abba!

&lt;p&gt;Philip said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father&amp;rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;I have said these things to you while I am still with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does not wisdom call, and does not understanding raise her voice?&lt;br&gt;
On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;&lt;br&gt;
beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries out:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to all that live.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD created me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.&lt;br&gt;
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.&lt;br&gt;
Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
when he had not yet made earth and fields, or the world&amp;rsquo;s first bits of soil.&lt;br&gt;
When he established the heavens, I was there, when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,&lt;br&gt;
when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,&lt;br&gt;
when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command,&lt;br&gt;
when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him, like a master worker;&lt;br&gt;
and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,&lt;br&gt;
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the human race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from first Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. And Ahab said to Naboth, &amp;ldquo;Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.&amp;rdquo; But Naboth said to Ahab, &amp;ldquo;The LORD forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance.&amp;rdquo; Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, &amp;ldquo;I will not give you my ancestral inheritance.&amp;rdquo; He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife Jezebel came to him and said, &amp;ldquo;Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?&amp;rdquo; He said to her, &amp;ldquo;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, &lt;code&gt;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it&#39;; but he answered, &lt;/code&gt;I will not give you my vineyard.&#39;&amp;rdquo; His wife Jezebel said to him, &amp;ldquo;Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she wrote letters in Ahab&amp;rsquo;s name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. She wrote in the letters, &amp;ldquo;Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly; seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, `You have cursed God and the king.&amp;rsquo; Then take him out, and stone him to death.&amp;rdquo; [The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly. The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &amp;ldquo;Naboth cursed God and the king.&amp;rdquo; So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &amp;ldquo;Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, &amp;ldquo;Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&amp;rdquo; As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. You shall say to him, &amp;ldquo;Thus says the LORD: Have you killed, and also taken possession?&amp;rdquo; You shall say to him, &amp;ldquo;Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahab said to Elijah, &amp;ldquo;Have you found me, O my enemy?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, I will bring disaster on you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law. But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor. For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee&amp;rsquo;s house and took his place at the table. And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee&amp;rsquo;s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him&amp;ndash; that she is a sinner.&amp;rdquo; Jesus spoke up and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Simon, I have something to say to you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Teacher,&amp;rdquo; he replied, &amp;ldquo;Speak.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?&amp;rdquo; Simon answered, &amp;ldquo;I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;You have judged rightly.&amp;rdquo; Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, &amp;ldquo;Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to her, &amp;ldquo;Your sins are forgiven.&amp;rdquo; But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, &amp;ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&amp;rdquo; And he said to the woman, &amp;ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Herod&amp;rsquo;s steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &amp;ldquo;So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&amp;rdquo; Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he himself went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: &amp;ldquo;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.&amp;rdquo; [Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and eat.&amp;rdquo; He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel of the LORD came a second time, touched him, and said, &amp;ldquo;Get up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.&amp;quot;] He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.&amp;rdquo; Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&amp;rdquo; Then the LORD said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to the promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus and his disciples arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. As he stepped out on land, a man of the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice, &amp;ldquo;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; for Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds.) Jesus then asked him, &amp;ldquo;What is your name?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Legion&amp;rdquo;; for many demons had entered him. They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, &amp;ldquo;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&amp;rdquo; So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, &amp;ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.&amp;rdquo; But Elisha said, &amp;ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&amp;rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Elijah said to him, &amp;ldquo;Stay here; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.&amp;rdquo; But he said, &amp;ldquo;As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&amp;rdquo; So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &amp;ldquo;Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.&amp;rdquo; Elisha said, &amp;ldquo;Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.&amp;rdquo; He responded, &amp;ldquo;You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.&amp;rdquo; As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven. Elisha kept watching and crying out, &amp;ldquo;Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&amp;rdquo; But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&amp;rdquo; When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, &amp;ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&amp;rdquo; If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the days drew near for Jesus to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him. On their way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him; but they did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw it, they said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?&amp;rdquo; But he turned and rebuked them. Then they went on to another village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they were going along the road, someone said to him, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you wherever you go.&amp;rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&amp;rdquo; To another he said, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo; But he said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&amp;rdquo; But Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo; Another said, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you, Lord; but let me first say farewell to those at my home.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from leprosy. Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman&amp;rsquo;s wife. She said to her mistress, &amp;ldquo;If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.&amp;rdquo; So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said. And the king of Aram said, &amp;ldquo;Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments. He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, &amp;ldquo;When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy.&amp;rdquo; When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, &amp;ldquo;Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, &amp;ldquo;Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel.&amp;rdquo; So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the entrance of Elisha&amp;rsquo;s house. Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.&amp;rdquo; But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, &amp;ldquo;I thought that for me he would surely come out, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and would wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy! Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?&amp;rdquo; He turned and went away in a rage. But his servants approached and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, `Wash, and be clean&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted. Bear one another&amp;rsquo;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. For if those who are nothing think they are something, they deceive themselves. All must test their own work; then that work, rather than their neighbor&amp;rsquo;s work, will become a cause for pride. For all must carry their own loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow. If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit. So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest-time, if we do not give up. So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand! It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised&amp;ndash; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh. May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything! As for those who will follow this rule&amp;ndash; peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go. He said to them, &amp;ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, &lt;code&gt;Peace to this house!&#39; And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person; but if not, it will return to you. Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house. Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the sick who are there, and say to them, &lt;/code&gt;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&amp;rsquo; But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, `Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventy returned with joy, saying, &amp;ldquo;Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Amos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. And the LORD said to me, &amp;ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&amp;rdquo; And I said, &amp;ldquo;A plumb line.&amp;rdquo; Then the Lord said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass them by;&lt;br&gt;
the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying, &amp;ldquo;Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. For thus Amos has said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Amaziah said to Amos, &amp;ldquo;O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there; but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king&amp;rsquo;s sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Amos answered Amaziah, &amp;ldquo;I am no prophet, nor a prophet&amp;rsquo;s son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now therefore hear the word of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
You say, &lt;code&gt;Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.&#39;  Therefore thus says the LORD:&lt;/code&gt;Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parceled out by line;&lt;br&gt;
you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God. This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf, and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God&amp;rsquo;s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God. May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. &amp;ldquo;Teacher,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&amp;rdquo; He said to him, &amp;ldquo;What is written in the law? What do you read there?&amp;rdquo; He answered, &amp;ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&amp;rdquo; And he said to him, &amp;ldquo;You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;And who is my neighbor?&amp;rdquo; Jesus replied, &amp;ldquo;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, `Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.&amp;rsquo; Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;The one who showed him mercy.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Go and do likewise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by.&lt;br&gt;
The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,&amp;rdquo; says the Lord GOD;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,&lt;br&gt;
saying, &amp;ldquo;When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain;&lt;br&gt;
and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?&lt;br&gt;

The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:&lt;br&gt;
Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.&lt;br&gt;
Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it,&lt;br&gt;
and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?&lt;br&gt;
On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.&lt;br&gt;
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation;&lt;br&gt;
I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head;&lt;br&gt;
I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.&lt;br&gt;
The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land;&lt;br&gt;
not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.&lt;br&gt;
They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&amp;ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him&amp;ndash; provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ&amp;rsquo;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church. I became its servant according to God&amp;rsquo;s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the Lord said to him, &amp;ldquo;Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them. But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by horses, or by horsemen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said, &amp;ldquo;Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, &amp;ldquo;You are not my people,&amp;rdquo; it shall be said to them, &amp;ldquo;Children of the living God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	You have been gracious to your land, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *&lt;br&gt;
and blotted out all their sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	You have withdrawn all your fury *&lt;br&gt;
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; *&lt;br&gt;
let your anger depart from us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? *&lt;br&gt;
will you prolong your anger from age to age?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Will you not give us life again, *&lt;br&gt;
that your people may rejoice in you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and grant us your salvation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, *&lt;br&gt;
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people&lt;br&gt;
and to those who turn their hearts to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
that his glory may dwell in our land.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	Mercy and truth have met together; *&lt;br&gt;
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, *&lt;br&gt;
and our land will yield its increase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Righteousness shall go before him, *&lt;br&gt;
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths. These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus was praying in a certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, &amp;ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;When you pray, say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, &lt;code&gt;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.&#39; And he answers from within, &lt;/code&gt;Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.&amp;rsquo; I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.&lt;br&gt;
The more I called them, the more they went from me;&lt;br&gt;
they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols.&lt;br&gt;
Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them.&lt;br&gt;
I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love.&lt;br&gt;
I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them.&lt;br&gt;
They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me.&lt;br&gt;
The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes.&lt;br&gt;
My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all.&lt;br&gt;
How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel?&lt;br&gt;
How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim?&lt;br&gt;
My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender.&lt;br&gt;
I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim;&lt;br&gt;
for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.&lt;br&gt;
They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion;&lt;br&gt;
when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.&lt;br&gt;
They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

and he delivered them from their distress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life. But now you must get rid of all such things&amp;ndash; anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator. In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!&lt;/p&gt;

Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one&amp;rsquo;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&amp;rdquo; Then he told them a parable: &amp;ldquo;The land of a rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, &lt;code&gt;What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?&#39; Then he said, &lt;/code&gt;I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, &lt;code&gt;Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.&#39; But God said to him, &lt;/code&gt;You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?&amp;rsquo; So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts;&lt;br&gt;
I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.&lt;br&gt;
When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more;&lt;br&gt;
bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me.&lt;br&gt;
New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation&amp;ndash; I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.&lt;br&gt;
Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;&lt;br&gt;
they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.&lt;br&gt;
When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;&lt;br&gt;
even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.&lt;br&gt;
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes;&lt;br&gt;
cease to do evil, learn to do good;&lt;br&gt;
seek justice, rescue the oppressed,&lt;br&gt;
defend the orphan, plead for the widow.&lt;br&gt;

though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.&lt;br&gt;
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&amp;ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&amp;ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, &amp;ldquo;as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.&lt;/p&gt;

Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them. If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it;&lt;br&gt;
he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.&lt;br&gt;
And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah,&lt;br&gt;
judge between me and my vineyard.&lt;br&gt;
What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?&lt;br&gt;
When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?&lt;br&gt;
And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.&lt;br&gt;
I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured;&lt;br&gt;
I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.&lt;br&gt;
I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns;&lt;br&gt;
I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.&lt;br&gt;
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,&lt;br&gt;
and the people of Judah are his pleasant planting;&lt;br&gt;
he expected justice, but saw bloodshed;&lt;br&gt;
righteousness, but heard a cry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; *&lt;br&gt;
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt; *&lt;br&gt;
you cast out the nations and planted it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;9 You prepared the ground for it; *&lt;br&gt;
it took root and filled the land.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 The mountains were covered by its shadow *&lt;br&gt;
and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11 You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea *&lt;br&gt;
and its branches to the River.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Why have you broken down its wall, *&lt;br&gt;
so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, *&lt;br&gt;
and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven;&lt;br&gt;
behold and tend this vine; *&lt;br&gt;
preserve what your right hand has planted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 They burn it with fire like rubbish; *&lt;br&gt;
at the rebuke of your countenance let them perish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, *&lt;br&gt;
the son of man you have made so strong for yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 And so will we never turn away from you; *&lt;br&gt;
give us life, that we may call upon your Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as if it were dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted to do so they were drowned. By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they had been encircled for seven days. By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had received the spies in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets&amp;ndash; who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, in order to obtain a better resurrection. Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, persecuted, tormented&amp;ndash; of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all these, though they were commended for their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better so that they would not, apart from us, be made perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and what stress I am under until it is completed! Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division! From now on five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three; they will be divided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;father against son and son against father,&lt;br&gt;

mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said to the crowds, &amp;ldquo;When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, &lt;code&gt;It is going to rain&#39;; and so it happens. And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, &lt;/code&gt;There will be scorching heat&amp;rsquo;; and it happens. You hypocrites!

&lt;p&gt;Then I said, &amp;ldquo;Ah, Lord GOD! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.&amp;rdquo; But the LORD said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not say, &amp;lsquo;I am only a boy&amp;rsquo;; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you, Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them. (For they could not endure the order that was given, &amp;ldquo;If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.&amp;rdquo; Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, &amp;ldquo;I tremble with fear.&amp;quot;) But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven! At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, &amp;ldquo;Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.&amp;rdquo; This phrase, &amp;ldquo;Yet once more,&amp;rdquo; indicates the removal of what is shaken&amp;ndash; that is, created things&amp;ndash; so that what cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe; for indeed our God is a consuming fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And just then there appeared a woman with a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years. She was bent over and was quite unable to stand up straight. When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, &amp;ldquo;Woman, you are set free from your ailment.&amp;rdquo; When he laid his hands on her, immediately she stood up straight and began praising God. But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had cured on the sabbath, kept saying to the crowd, &amp;ldquo;There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be cured, and not on the sabbath day.&amp;rdquo; But the Lord answered him and said, &amp;ldquo;You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger, and lead it away to give it water? And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the sabbath day?&amp;rdquo; When he said this, all his opponents were put to shame; and the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things that he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What wrong did your ancestors find in me that they went far from me,&lt;br&gt;
and went after worthless things, and became worthless themselves?&lt;br&gt;
They did not say, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt,&lt;br&gt;
who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits,&lt;br&gt;
in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, where no one lives?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I brought you into a plentiful land to eat its fruits and its good things.&lt;br&gt;
But when you entered you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.&lt;br&gt;
The priests did not say, &amp;ldquo;Where is the LORD?&amp;rdquo; Those who handle the law did not know me;&lt;br&gt;
the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after things that do not profit.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore once more I accuse you, says the LORD, and I accuse your children&amp;rsquo;s children.&lt;br&gt;
Cross to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has ever been such a thing.&lt;br&gt;
Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods?&lt;br&gt;
But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit.&lt;br&gt;
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured. Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, &amp;ldquo;I will never leave you or forsake you.&amp;rdquo; So we can say with confidence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were watching him closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. &amp;ldquo;When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, &lt;code&gt;Give this person your place,&#39; and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, &lt;/code&gt;Friend, move up higher&amp;rsquo;; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said also to the one who had invited him, &amp;ldquo;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&amp;rsquo;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.&lt;/p&gt;

Just like the clay in the potter&amp;rsquo;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *&lt;br&gt;
you know my sitting down and my rising up;&lt;br&gt;
you discern my thoughts from afar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *&lt;br&gt;
and are acquainted with all my ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *&lt;br&gt;
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 You press upon me behind and before *&lt;br&gt;
and lay your hand upon me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *&lt;br&gt;
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 For you yourself created my inmost parts; *&lt;br&gt;
you knit me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *&lt;br&gt;
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 My body was not hidden from you, *&lt;br&gt;
while I was being made in secret&lt;br&gt;
and woven in the depths of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;&lt;br&gt;
all of them were written in your book; *&lt;br&gt;
they were fashioned day by day,&lt;br&gt;
when as yet there was none of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16 How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *&lt;br&gt;
how great is the sum of them!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *&lt;br&gt;
to count them all, my life span would need to be like yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to Philemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus. I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ. I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty, yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love&amp;ndash; and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother&amp;ndash; especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus; and he turned and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, `This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.&amp;rsquo; Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A hot wind comes from me out of the bare heights in the desert toward my poor people, not to winnow or cleanse&amp;ndash; a wind too strong for that. Now it is I who speak in judgment against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.&lt;br&gt;
I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.&lt;br&gt;
I looked, and lo, there was no one at all, and all the birds of the air had fled.&lt;br&gt;
I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thus says the LORD: The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above grow black;&lt;br&gt;

But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&amp;ndash; of whom I am the foremost. But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience, making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life. To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he told them this parable: &amp;ldquo;Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, `Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.&amp;rsquo; Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, `Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.&amp;rsquo; Just so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. So he summoned him and said to him, &lt;code&gt;What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.&#39; Then the manager said to himself, &lt;/code&gt;What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.&amp;rsquo; So, summoning his master&amp;rsquo;s debtors one by one, he asked the first, &lt;code&gt;How much do you owe my master?&#39; He answered, &lt;/code&gt;A hundred jugs of olive oil.&amp;rsquo; He said to him, &lt;code&gt;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.&#39; Then he asked another, &lt;/code&gt;And how much do you owe?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &lt;code&gt;A hundred containers of wheat.&#39; He said to him, &lt;/code&gt;Take your bill and make it eighty.&amp;rsquo; And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of dishonest wealth so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah, where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me: Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, &amp;ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.&amp;rdquo; Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, &amp;ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.&amp;rdquo; Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;

I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy; and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. In their presence I charged Baruch, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.&lt;/p&gt;

I am with him in trouble;&lt;br&gt;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-386&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is great gain in godliness combined with contentment; for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it; but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will bring about at the right time&amp;ndash; he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords. It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&amp;rsquo;s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores. The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, &lt;code&gt;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.&#39; But Abraham said, &lt;/code&gt;Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.&amp;rsquo; He said, &lt;code&gt;Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father&#39;s house-- for I have five brothers-- that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.&#39; Abraham replied, &lt;/code&gt;They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.&amp;rsquo; He said, &lt;code&gt;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&#39; He said to him, &lt;/code&gt;If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How lonely sits the city that once was full of people!&lt;br&gt;
How like a widow she has become, she that was great among the nations!&lt;br&gt;
She that was a princess among the provinces has become a vassal.&lt;br&gt;
She weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks;&lt;br&gt;
among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her;&lt;br&gt;
all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;
Judah has gone into exile with suffering and hard servitude;&lt;br&gt;
she lives now among the nations, and finds no resting place;&lt;br&gt;
her pursuers have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress.&lt;br&gt;
The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the festivals;&lt;br&gt;
all her gates are desolate, her priests groan;&lt;br&gt;
her young girls grieve, and her lot is bitter.&lt;br&gt;
Her foes have become the masters, her enemies prosper,&lt;br&gt;
because the LORD has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions;&lt;br&gt;
her children have gone away, captives before the foe.&lt;br&gt;
From daughter Zion has departed all her majesty.&lt;br&gt;
Her princes have become like stags that find no pasture;&lt;br&gt;
they fled without strength before the pursuer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My soul continually thinks of it and is bowed down within me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, for the sake of the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Timothy, my beloved child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to God&amp;ndash; whom I worship with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did&amp;ndash; when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, lives in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be ashamed, then, of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God, who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace. This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher, and for this reason I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard until that day what I have entrusted to him. Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Guard the good treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit living in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David&amp;ndash; that is my gospel, for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. The saying is sure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful&amp;ndash; for he cannot deny himself.&lt;/p&gt;

Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus&amp;rsquo; feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, &amp;ldquo;Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?&amp;rdquo; Then he said to him, &amp;ldquo;Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals.

It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt&amp;ndash; a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, &amp;ldquo;Know the LORD,&amp;rdquo; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.&lt;/p&gt;

therefore I hate every lying way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it, and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart. He said, &amp;ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, &lt;code&gt;Grant me justice against my opponent.&#39; For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, &lt;/code&gt;Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.&#39;&amp;rdquo; And the Lord said, &amp;ldquo;Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them? I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God;&lt;br&gt;
for he has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the later rain, as before.&lt;br&gt;
The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.&lt;br&gt;
I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust has eaten,&lt;br&gt;
the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent against you.&lt;br&gt;
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you.&lt;br&gt;
And my people shall never again be put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is no other.&lt;br&gt;
And my people shall never again be put to shame.&lt;br&gt;
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh;&lt;br&gt;
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.&lt;br&gt;
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes. Then everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.&lt;/p&gt;

From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them! But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion&amp;rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, &lt;code&gt;God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.&#39; But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, &lt;/code&gt;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&amp;rsquo; I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw.&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen?&lt;br&gt;
Or cry to you &amp;ldquo;Violence!&amp;rdquo; and you will not save?&lt;br&gt;
Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble?&lt;br&gt;
Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.&lt;br&gt;
So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails.&lt;br&gt;
The wicked surround the righteous&amp;ndash; therefore judgment comes forth perverted.&lt;br&gt;
I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;&lt;br&gt;
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.&lt;br&gt;
Then the LORD answered me and said:&lt;br&gt;
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.&lt;br&gt;
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.&lt;br&gt;
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.&lt;br&gt;
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.&amp;rdquo; So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, &amp;ldquo;He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.&amp;rdquo; Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.&amp;rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing? Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts, according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear. For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts. The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as though from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed, the one destined for destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him a question, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&amp;rsquo;s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first married, and died childless; then the second and the third married her, and so in the same way all seven died childless. Finally the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had married her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. Indeed they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed, in the story about the bush, where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Now he is God not of the dead, but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;&lt;br&gt;
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.&lt;br&gt;
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;&lt;br&gt;
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.&lt;br&gt;
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;&lt;br&gt;
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.&lt;br&gt;
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;&lt;br&gt;
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.&lt;br&gt;
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;&lt;br&gt;
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&lt;br&gt;
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;&lt;br&gt;
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&amp;ndash; and their descendants as well.&lt;br&gt;
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.&lt;br&gt;
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&amp;ndash; its food shall be dust!&lt;br&gt;
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, and we did not eat anyone&amp;rsquo;s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you. This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked him, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, &lt;code&gt;I am he!&#39; and, &lt;/code&gt;The time is near!&amp;rsquo; Do not go after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&amp;rdquo; Then he said to them, &amp;ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.

He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.&lt;/p&gt;

Then Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &amp;ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&amp;rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &amp;ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&amp;rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &amp;ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &amp;ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&amp;rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &amp;ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&amp;rdquo; Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.” Immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will stand at my watchpost, and station myself on the rampart;&lt;br&gt;
I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, and what he will answer concerning my complaint.&lt;br&gt;
Then the LORD answered me and said:&lt;br&gt;
Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so that a runner may read it.&lt;br&gt;
For there is still a vision for the appointed time; it speaks of the end, and does not lie.&lt;br&gt;
If it seems to tarry, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay.&lt;br&gt;
Look at the proud! Their spirit is not right in them, but the righteous live by their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *&lt;br&gt;
then were we like those who dream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *&lt;br&gt;
and our tongue with shouts of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Then they said among the nations, *&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	The LORD has done great things for us, *&lt;br&gt;
and we are glad indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
like the watercourses of the Negev.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	Those who sowed with tears *&lt;br&gt;
will reap with songs of joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised. For yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“in a very little while,&lt;br&gt;
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;&lt;br&gt;
but my righteous one will live by faith.&lt;br&gt;
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with the other disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.” Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the LORD: Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD&amp;rsquo;s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD; speak to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word. It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their evil doings. You shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently&amp;ndash; though you have not heeded&amp;ndash; then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, &amp;ldquo;You shall die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, `This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, &amp;ldquo;It is the LORD who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against you. But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

let me never be put to shame; *&lt;br&gt;
deliver me in your righteousness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Incline your ear to me; *&lt;br&gt;
make haste to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,&lt;br&gt;
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *&lt;br&gt;
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *&lt;br&gt;
for you are my tower of strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Into your hands I commend my spirit, *&lt;br&gt;
for you have redeemed me,&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, O God of truth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *&lt;br&gt;
and I put my trust in the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *&lt;br&gt;
for you have seen my affliction;&lt;br&gt;
you know my distress.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *&lt;br&gt;
you have set my feet in an open place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *&lt;br&gt;
my eye is consumed with sorrow,&lt;br&gt;
and also my throat and my belly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For my life is wasted with grief,&lt;br&gt;
and my years with sighing; *&lt;br&gt;
my strength fails me because of affliction,&lt;br&gt;
and my bones are consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors,&lt;br&gt;
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *&lt;br&gt;
when they see me in the street they avoid me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *&lt;br&gt;
I am as useless as a broken pot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;&lt;br&gt;
fear is all around; *&lt;br&gt;
they put their heads together against me;&lt;br&gt;
they plot to take my life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *&lt;br&gt;
I have said, &amp;ldquo;You are my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	My times are in your hand; *&lt;br&gt;
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
and from those who persecute me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	Make your face to shine upon your servant, *&lt;br&gt;
and in your loving-kindness save me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *&lt;br&gt;
rather, let the wicked be put to shame;&lt;br&gt;
let them be silent in the grave.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
haughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	How great is your goodness, O LORD!&lt;br&gt;
which you have laid up for those who fear you; *&lt;br&gt;
which you have done in the sight of all&lt;br&gt;
for those who put their trust in you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who slander them; *&lt;br&gt;
you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	Blessed be the LORD! *&lt;br&gt;
for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged city.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22	Yet I said in my alarm,&lt;br&gt;
I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.&amp;rdquo; *&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty&lt;br&gt;
when I cried out to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23	Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *&lt;br&gt;
the LORD protects the faithful,&lt;br&gt;
but repays to the full those who act haughtily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;24	Be strong and let your heart take courage, *&lt;br&gt;
all you who wait for the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and others of those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated some men to say, &amp;ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&amp;rdquo; They stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes; then they suddenly confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council. They set up false witnesses who said, &amp;ldquo;This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed on to us.&amp;rdquo; And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the high priest asked him, &amp;ldquo;Are these things so?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Stephen replied: &amp;ldquo;Brothers and fathers, listen to me. You are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do. Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers. You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen. But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. &amp;ldquo;Look,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&amp;rdquo; But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, &amp;ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&amp;rdquo; Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&amp;rdquo; When he had said this, he died.&lt;/p&gt;

If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true; but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to Peter, &amp;ldquo;Follow me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; he was the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?&amp;rdquo; When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, &amp;ldquo;Lord, what about him?&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to him, &amp;ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!&amp;rdquo; So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, &amp;ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the one who was seated on the throne said, “See, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.” Then he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life. Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be my children.&lt;/p&gt;

This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, &amp;ldquo;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul said to King Agrippa, &amp;ldquo;Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death. By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests, when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, &lt;code&gt;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.&#39; I asked, &lt;/code&gt;Who are you, Lord?&amp;rsquo; The Lord answered, `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you. I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles&amp;ndash; to whom I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance. For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin; for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me apart before I was born and called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with any human being, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were already apostles before me, but I went away at once into Arabia, and afterwards I returned to Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days; but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord&amp;rsquo;s brother. In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie! Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ; they only heard it said, &amp;ldquo;The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.&amp;rdquo; And they glorified God because of me.&lt;/p&gt;

Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	How dear to me is your dwelling, O LORD of hosts! *&lt;br&gt;
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD;&lt;br&gt;
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The sparrow has found her a house&lt;br&gt;
and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young; *&lt;br&gt;
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts,&lt;br&gt;
my King and my God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	Happy are they who dwell in your house! *&lt;br&gt;
they will always be praising you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4	Happy are the people whose strength is in you! *&lt;br&gt;
whose hearts are set on the pilgrims&amp;rsquo; way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5	Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a place of springs, *&lt;br&gt;
for the early rains have covered it with pools of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	They will climb from height to height, *&lt;br&gt;
and the God of gods will reveal himself in Zion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *&lt;br&gt;
hearken, O God of Jacob.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8	Behold our defender, O God; *&lt;br&gt;
and look upon the face of your Anointed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	For one day in your courts is better than&lt;br&gt;
a thousand in my own room, *&lt;br&gt;
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God&lt;br&gt;
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *&lt;br&gt;
he will give grace and glory;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11	No good thing will the LORD withhold *&lt;br&gt;
from those who walk with integrity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12	O LORD of hosts, *&lt;br&gt;
happy are they who put their trust in you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since God&amp;rsquo;s children share flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&amp;rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &amp;ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;&lt;br&gt;
for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,&lt;br&gt;
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the child&amp;rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &amp;ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&amp;ndash; and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said, &amp;ldquo;Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus&amp;ndash; for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.&amp;rdquo; (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) &amp;ldquo;For it is written in the book of Psalms,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it&amp;rsquo;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us&amp;ndash; one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection.&amp;rdquo; So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, &amp;ldquo;Lord, you know everyone&amp;rsquo;s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&amp;rdquo; And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you. Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&amp;rsquo;s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one&amp;rsquo;s life for one&amp;rsquo;s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. When he commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use, with blows inflicted by human beings. But I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us, as it is written, &amp;ldquo;I have made you the father of many nations&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become &amp;ldquo;the father of many nations,&amp;rdquo; according to what was said, &amp;ldquo;So numerous shall your descendants be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parents of Jesus went to Jerusalem every year for the festival of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival. When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, &amp;ldquo;Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.&amp;rdquo; He said to them, &amp;ldquo;Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&amp;rsquo;s house?&amp;rdquo; But they did not understand what he said to them. Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying, Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test. Then Isaiah said: “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me;&lt;br&gt;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.&lt;br&gt;
Then I said, ‘See, God, I have come to do your will, O God’ (in the scroll of the book it is written of me).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said above, &amp;ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&amp;rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &amp;ldquo;See, I have come to do your will.&amp;rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God&amp;rsquo;s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive; he gave gifts to his people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ. We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people&amp;rsquo;s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body&amp;rsquo;s growth in building itself up in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;&lt;br&gt;
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: `Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&amp;rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, &amp;ldquo;The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, &amp;ldquo;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, &amp;ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is by God&amp;rsquo;s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart. We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God&amp;rsquo;s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&amp;rsquo; sake. For it is the God who said, &amp;ldquo;Let light shine out of darkness,&amp;rdquo; who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father&amp;rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves. Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.

&lt;p&gt;Hannah prayed and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My heart exults in the Lord;&lt;br&gt;
my strength is exalted in my God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My mouth derides my enemies,&lt;br&gt;
because I rejoice in my victory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There is no Holy One like the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
no one besides you;&lt;br&gt;
there is no Rock like our God.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Talk no more so very proudly,&lt;br&gt;
let not arrogance come from your mouth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the Lord is a God of knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
and by him actions are weighed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The bows of the mighty are broken,&lt;br&gt;
but the feeble gird on strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,&lt;br&gt;
but those who were hungry are fat with spoil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The barren has borne seven,&lt;br&gt;
but she who has many children is forlorn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord kills and brings to life;&lt;br&gt;
he brings down to Sheol and raises up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Lord makes poor and makes rich;&lt;br&gt;
he brings low, he also exalts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raises up the poor from the dust;&lt;br&gt;
he lifts the needy from the ash heap,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;to make them sit with princes&lt;br&gt;
and inherit a seat of honour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s,&lt;br&gt;
and on them he has set the world.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;‘He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,&lt;br&gt;
but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness;&lt;br&gt;
for not by might does one prevail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord! His adversaries shall be shattered;&lt;br&gt;
the Most High will thunder in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;&lt;br&gt;
he will give strength to his king,&lt;br&gt;
and exalt the power of his anointed.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Do not lag in zeal, be ardent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in suffering, persevere in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints; extend hospitality to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth heard Mary&amp;rsquo;s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, &amp;ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,&lt;br&gt;
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;&lt;br&gt;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.&lt;br&gt;
His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.&lt;br&gt;
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.&lt;br&gt;
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;&lt;br&gt;
he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.&lt;br&gt;
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,&lt;br&gt;
according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.&lt;/p&gt;

I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;&lt;br&gt;
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,&lt;br&gt;
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.&lt;br&gt;
I am the LORD, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.&lt;br&gt;
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews. But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion; for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord. Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to the twelve, “As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. As you enter the house, greet it. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.&lt;br&gt;
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her&lt;br&gt;
that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid,&lt;br&gt;
that she has received from the LORD&amp;rsquo;s hand double for all her sins.&lt;br&gt;
A voice cries out:&lt;br&gt;
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.&lt;br&gt;
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low;&lt;br&gt;
the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.&lt;br&gt;
Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”&lt;br&gt;
A voice says, “Cry out!” And I said, “What shall I cry?”&lt;br&gt;
All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.&lt;br&gt;
The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.&lt;br&gt;
Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings;&lt;br&gt;

See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: “You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’ Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised; before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father. But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.” They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.” Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him. He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God. Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea. All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favourably on his people and redeemed them.&lt;br&gt;
He has raised up a mighty saviour for us in the house of his servant David,&lt;br&gt;
as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.&lt;br&gt;
Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant,&lt;br&gt;
the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,&lt;br&gt;
might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.”&lt;br&gt;
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,&lt;br&gt;
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.&lt;br&gt;
By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us,&lt;br&gt;
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land. I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.” (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, “Follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old&amp;ndash; and Sarah herself was barren&amp;ndash; because he considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, “as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.&lt;/p&gt;

For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;

But you are the God of the lowly, helper of the oppressed, upholder of the weak, protector of the forsaken, savior of those without hope. Please, please, God of my father, God of the heritage of Israel, Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of the waters, King of all your creation, hear my prayer! Make my deceitful words bring wound and bruise on those who have planned cruel things against your covenant, and against your sacred house, and against Mount Zion, and against the house your children possess.

&lt;p&gt;The love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died and was raised for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view; even though we once knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in that way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Magdalene stood weeping outside the tomb.

They said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&amp;rdquo; She said to them, &amp;ldquo;They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&amp;rdquo; When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?&amp;rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&amp;rdquo; Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Mary!&amp;rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &amp;ldquo;Rabbouni!&amp;rdquo; (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &amp;ldquo;Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, &amp;ldquo;I have seen the Lord&amp;rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: You said, “Woe is me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.” Thus you shall say to him, “Thus says the LORD: I am going to break down what I have built, and pluck up what I have planted—that is, the whole land. And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am going to bring disaster upon all flesh, says the LORD; but I will give you your life as a prize of war in every place to which you may go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domine, Deus meus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; *&lt;br&gt;
save and deliver me from all who pursue me;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 Lest like a lion they tear me in pieces *&lt;br&gt;
and snatch me away with none to deliver me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 O LORD my God, if I have done these things: *&lt;br&gt;
if there is any wickedness in my hands,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 If I have repaid my friend with evil, *&lt;br&gt;
or plundered him who without cause is my enemy;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Then let my enemy pursue and overtake me, *&lt;br&gt;
trample my life into the ground,&lt;br&gt;
and lay my honor in the dust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 Stand up, O LORD, in your wrath; *&lt;br&gt;
rise up against the fury of my enemies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Awake, O my God, decree justice; *&lt;br&gt;
let the assembly of the peoples gather round you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Be seated on your lofty throne, O Most High; *&lt;br&gt;
O LORD, judge the nations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 Give judgment for me according to my righteousness, O LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and according to my innocence, O Most High.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,&lt;br&gt;
but establish the righteous; *&lt;br&gt;
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword. After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling before him, she asked a favor of him. And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Declare that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers. But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave; just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Peter’s second epistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory, since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.” We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one&amp;rsquo;s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” —not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;

I will protect him, because he knows my Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I will rescue him and bring him to honor.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dispute arose among the disciples as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited,&lt;br&gt;
but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness.&lt;br&gt;
And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death— even death on a cross.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,&lt;br&gt;
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,&lt;br&gt;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;

And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”&lt;/p&gt;

When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.

&lt;p&gt;Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the LORD stood beside him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid, and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah,&lt;br&gt;
for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.&lt;br&gt;
But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,&lt;br&gt;
for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them!&lt;br&gt;
But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you&lt;br&gt;
with great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honor physicians for their services, for the Lord created them;&lt;br&gt;
for their gift of healing comes from the Most High, and they are rewarded by the king.&lt;br&gt;
The skill of physicians makes them distinguished, and in the presence of the great they are admired.&lt;br&gt;
The Lord created medicines out of the earth, and the sensible will not despise them.&lt;br&gt;
And he gave skill to human beings that he might be glorified in his marvelous works.&lt;br&gt;
By them the physician heals and takes away pain; the pharmacist makes a mixture from them.&lt;br&gt;
God’s works will never be finished; and from him health spreads over all the earth.&lt;br&gt;
My child, when you are ill, do not delay, but pray to the Lord, and he will heal you.&lt;br&gt;
Give up your faults and direct your hands rightly, and cleanse your heart from all sin.&lt;br&gt;
Then give the physician his place, for the Lord created him; do not let him leave you, for you need him.&lt;br&gt;
There may come a time when recovery lies in the hands of physicians, for they too pray to the Lord&lt;br&gt;
that he grant them success in diagnosis and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.&lt;/p&gt;

how pleasant it is to honor him with praise!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
he gathers the exiles of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3	He heals the brokenhearted *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; *&lt;br&gt;

and prepares rain for the earth;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9	He makes grass to grow upon the mountains *&lt;br&gt;
and green plants to serve mankind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10	He provides food for flocks and herds *&lt;br&gt;
and for the young ravens when they cry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11	He is not impressed by the might of a horse; *&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12	But the LORD has pleasure in those who fear him, *&lt;br&gt;
in those who await his gracious favor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13	Worship the LORD, O Jerusalem; *&lt;br&gt;
praise your God, O Zion;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14	For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; *&lt;br&gt;
he has blessed your children within you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15	He has established peace on your borders; *&lt;br&gt;
he satisfies you with the finest wheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16	He sends out his command to the earth, *&lt;br&gt;
and his word runs very swiftly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17	He gives snow like wool; *&lt;br&gt;
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18	He scatters his hail like bread crumbs; *&lt;br&gt;
who can stand against his cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19	He sends forth his word and melts them; *&lt;br&gt;
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20	He declares his word to Jacob, *&lt;br&gt;
his statutes and his judgments to Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21	He has not done so to any other nation; *&lt;br&gt;
to them he has not revealed his judgments.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your best to come to me soon, for Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, filled with the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and a report about him spread through all the surrounding country. He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,&lt;br&gt;
because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.&lt;br&gt;
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free,&lt;br&gt;
to proclaim the year of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them, &amp;ldquo;Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the apostles and elders kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, “My brothers, listen to me. Simeon has related how God first looked favorably on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name. This agrees with the words of the prophets, as it is written,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘After this I will return,&lt;br&gt;
and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; from its ruins I will rebuild it, and I will set it up,&lt;br&gt;
so that all other peoples may seek the Lord&amp;ndash; even all the Gentiles over whom my name has been called.&lt;br&gt;
Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things known from long ago.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood. For in every city, for generations past, Moses has had those who proclaim him, for he has been read aloud every sabbath in the synagogues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1	Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *&lt;br&gt;
nor lingered in the way of sinners,&lt;br&gt;
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *&lt;br&gt;
and they meditate on his law day and night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4	It is not so with the wicked; *&lt;br&gt;
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *&lt;br&gt;
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6	For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *&lt;br&gt;
but the way of the wicked is doomed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you&amp;ndash;unless you have come to believe in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them&amp;ndash;though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?” And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor except in their own country and in their own house.” And he did not do many deeds of power there, because of their unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in Christ Jesus you Gentiles, who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to his disciples, “I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you. If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world&amp;ndash; therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘Servants are not greater than their master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. It was to fulfill the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf. You also are to testify because you have been with me from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the prophet Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me, and the visions of my head terrified me. I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: &amp;ldquo;As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever—for ever and ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-614&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Ephesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God&amp;rsquo;s own people, to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;lector-616&#34;&gt;Lector:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading from Luke’s Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus looked up at his disciples and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.&lt;br&gt;
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, &amp;ldquo;Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have come into the land that the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.&amp;rdquo; When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the LORD your God, you shall make this response before the LORD your God: &amp;ldquo;A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors; the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O LORD, have given me.&amp;rdquo; You shall set it down before the LORD your God and bow down before the LORD your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1	Be joyful in the LORD, all you lands; *&lt;br&gt;
serve the LORD with gladness&lt;br&gt;
and come before his presence with a song.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2	Know this: The LORD himself is God; *&lt;br&gt;

we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, beloved, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the crowd found Jesus on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &amp;ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.&amp;rdquo; Then they said to him, &amp;ldquo;What must we do to perform the works of God?&amp;rdquo; Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&amp;rdquo; So they said to him, &amp;ldquo;What sign are you going to give us then, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing? Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#39;&amp;rdquo; Then Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&amp;rdquo; They said to him, &amp;ldquo;Sir, give us this bread always.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h5 id=&#34;pb&#34;&gt;pb&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-gather-in-gods-name&#34;&gt;We Gather in God&amp;rsquo;s Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lighting-the-candles-of-the-advent-wreath&#34;&gt;Lighting the Candles of the Advent Wreath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we light the first candle of the Advent wreath. Each candle has a meaning. The first candle is HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. (Psalm 33:20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal God, as we await the coming of our savior, give us the courage to hope. Give us grace to see your plans of redemption for our lives, for this community, and for the world. Through Jesus Christ, the source of our redemption and hope. &lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anthem-_o-come-o-come-emmanuel_-vv-1-2-hymnal-56&#34;&gt;Anthem: &lt;em&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 1-2) (Hymnal 56)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,&lt;br&gt;
that mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O come, Thou Wisdom from on high, who orderest all things mightily;&lt;br&gt;
to us the path of knowledge show, and teach us in her ways to go.&lt;br&gt;
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O God the Father, Creator of heaven and earth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Son, Redeemer of the world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God the Holy Ghost, Sanctifier of the faithful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, one God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have mercy upon us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember not, Lord Christ, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers; neither reward us according to our sins. Spare us, good Lord, spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood, and by thy mercy preserve us for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spare us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all evil and wickedness; from sin; from the crafts and assaults of the devil; and from everlasting damnation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all blindness of heart; from pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice; and from all want of charity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all inordinate and sinful affections; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all false doctrine, heresy, and schism; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and commandment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mystery of thy holy Incarnation; by thy holy Nativity and submission to the Law; by thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thine Agony and Bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and Passion; by thy precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious Resurrection and Ascension; and by the Coming of the Holy Ghost,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all time of our tribulation; in all time of our prosperity; in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Lord, deliver us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sinners do beseech thee to hear us, O Lord God; and that it may please thee to rule and govern thy holy Church Universal in the right way,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it may please thee to illumine all bishops, priests, and deacons, with true knowledge and understanding of thy Word; and that both by their preaching and living, they may set it forth, and show it accordingly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: &amp;ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we abound in love for you.

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see &amp;lsquo;the Son of Man coming in a cloud&amp;rsquo; with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he told them a parable: &amp;ldquo;Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to his command, O Father,&lt;/p&gt;

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

on earth as it is in heaven.&lt;br&gt;
Give us this day our daily bread.&lt;br&gt;
And forgive us our trespasses,&lt;br&gt;
as we forgive those who trespass against us.&lt;br&gt;
And lead us not into temptation,&lt;br&gt;
but deliver us from evil.&lt;br&gt;
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,&lt;br&gt;
for ever and ever.  Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiving Communion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).&lt;/em&gt; (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.&lt;/em&gt; (BCP, 457)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-for-spiritual-communion&#34;&gt;Prayer for Spiritual Communion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food&lt;br&gt;
of the most precious Body and Blood&lt;br&gt;
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries&lt;br&gt;
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,&lt;br&gt;
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
And now, Father, send us out&lt;br&gt;
to do the work you have given us to do,&lt;br&gt;
to love and serve you&lt;br&gt;
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.&lt;br&gt;
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,&lt;br&gt;
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
