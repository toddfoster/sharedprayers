<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from first Kings.</p>
<p>Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &ldquo;So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&rdquo; Then he was afraid; he got up and fled for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah; he left his servant there.</p>
<p>But he himself went a day&rsquo;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: &ldquo;It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.&rdquo; [Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, &ldquo;Get up and eat.&rdquo; He looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again. The angel of the LORD came a second time, touched him, and said, &ldquo;Get up and eat, otherwise the journey will be too much for you.&rdquo;] He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God. At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.&rdquo; Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to him, &ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Quemadmodum</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	As the deer longs for the water-brooks, *<br>
so longs my soul for you, O God.<br>
<strong>2	My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God; *<br>
when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	My tears have been my food day and night, *<br>
while all day long they say to me,<br>
Where now is your God?&quot;<br>
<strong>4	I pour out my soul when I think on these things; *<br>
how I went with the multitude and led them into the house of God,</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *<br>
among those who keep holy-day.<br>
<strong>6	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *<br>
and why are you so disquieted within me?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Put your trust in God; *<br>
for I will yet give thanks to him,<br>
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.<br>
<strong>8	My soul is heavy within me; *<br>
therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan,<br>
and from the peak of Mizar among the heights of Hermon.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	One deep calls to another in the noise of your cataracts; *<br>
all your rapids and floods have gone over me.<br>
<strong>10	The LORD grants his loving-kindness in the daytime; *<br>
in the night season his song is with me,<br>
a prayer to the God of my life.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	I will say to the God of my strength,<br>
&ldquo;Why have you forgotten me? *<br>
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy<br>
oppresses me?&rdquo;<br>
<strong>12	While my bones are being broken, *<br>
my enemies mock me to my face;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	All day long they mock me *<br>
and say to me, &ldquo;Where now is your God?&rdquo;<br>
<strong>14	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *<br>
and why are you so disquieted within me?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Put your trust in God; *<br>
for I will yet give thanks to him,<br>
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Judica me, Deus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	Give judgment for me, O God,<br>
and defend my cause against an ungodly people; *<br>
deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.<br>
<strong>2	For you are the God of my strength;<br>
why have you put me from you? *<br>
and why do I go so heavily while the enemy<br>
oppresses me?</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, *<br>
and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling;<br>
<strong>4	That I may go to the altar of God,<br>
to the God of my joy and gladness; *<br>
and on the harp I will give thanks to you, O God my God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? *<br>
and why are you so disquieted within me?<br>
<strong>6	Put your trust in God; *<br>
for I will yet give thanks to him,<br>
who is the help of my countenance, and my God.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the Galatians.</p>
<p>Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to the promise.</p>

<p>Jesus and his disciples arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. As he stepped out on land, a man of the city who had demons met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he did not live in a house but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him and shouted at the top of his voice, &ldquo;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me&rdquo; &ndash; for Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many times it had seized him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilds.) Jesus then asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo;; for many demons had entered him. They begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss.</p>
<p>Now there on the hillside a large herd of swine was feeding; and the demons begged Jesus to let them enter these. So he gave them permission. Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</p>
<p>When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying, &ldquo;Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.&rdquo; So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
