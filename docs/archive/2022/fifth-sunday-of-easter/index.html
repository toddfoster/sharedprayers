<h3 id="the-first-lesson-acts-111-18">The First Lesson: <em>Acts 11:1-18</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him, saying, &ldquo;Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?&rdquo; Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying, &ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. I also heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Get up, Peter; kill and eat.&rsquo; But I replied, &lsquo;By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&rsquo; But a second time the voice answered from heaven, &lsquo;What God has made clean, you must not call profane.&rsquo; This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven. At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were. The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s house. He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, &lsquo;Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter; he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.&rsquo; And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, &lsquo;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo; If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?&rdquo; When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, &ldquo;Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them as their God; they will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more, for the first things have passed away.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And the one who was seated on the throne said, &ldquo;See, I am making all things new.&rdquo; Also he said, &ldquo;Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.&rdquo; Then he said to me, &ldquo;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.&rdquo;</p>

If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.&rsquo; I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>

I come with joy to meet my Lord,<br>
forgiven, loved, and free,<br>
in awe and wonder to recall,<br>
his life laid down for me.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I come with Christians far and near<br>
to find, as all are fed,<br>
the new community of love<br>
in Christ&rsquo;s communion bread.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
As Christ breaks bread, and bids us share,<br>
each proud division ends.<br>
The love that made us, makes us one,<br>
and strangers now are friends.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.<br>
His presence, always near,<br>
is in such friendship better known,<br>
we see and praise him here.</p></blockquote>

Together met, together bound,<br>
we&rsquo;ll go our different ways<br>
and as his people in the world,<br>
we&rsquo;ll live and speak his praise.</p></blockquote>
