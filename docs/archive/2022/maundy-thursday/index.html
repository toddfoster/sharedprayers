<p>A reading from the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbor in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. [Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.] This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the LORD. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.</p>

<p>Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”</p>
<p>After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord&ndash;and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</p>
<p>“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, `Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<h2 id="stripping-and-washing-of-the-altar">Stripping and Washing of the Altar</h2>
<p><strong>Psalm 22</strong><br>
<em>Deus, Deus meu</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? *<br>
and are so far from my cry<br>
and from the words of my distress?<br>
2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not answer; *<br>
by night as well, but I find no rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Yet you are the Holy One, *<br>
enthroned upon the praises of Israel.<br>
4	Our forefathers put their trust in you; *<br>
they trusted, and you delivered them.<br>
5	They cried out to you and were delivered; *<br>
they trusted in you and were not put to shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6	But as for me, I am a worm and no man, *<br>
scorned by all and despised by the people.<br>
7	All who see me laugh me to scorn; *<br>
they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,<br>
8	&ldquo;He trusted in the LORD; let him deliver him; *<br>
let him rescue him, if he delights in him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Yet you are he who took me out of the womb, *<br>
and kept me safe upon my mother&rsquo;s breast.<br>
10	I have been entrusted to you ever since I was born; *<br>
you were my God when I was still in my mother&rsquo;s womb.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near, *<br>
and there is none to help.<br>
12	Many young bulls encircle me; *<br>
strong bulls of Bashan surround me.<br>
13	They open wide their jaws at me, *<br>
like a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>14	I am poured out like water;<br>
all my bones are out of joint; *<br>
my heart within my breast is melting wax.<br>
15	My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd;<br>
my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; *<br>
and you have laid me in the dust of the grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>16	Packs of dogs close me in,<br>
and gangs of evildoers circle around me; *<br>
they pierce my hands and my feet;<br>
I can count all my bones.<br>
17	They stare and gloat over me; *<br>
they divide my garments among them;<br>
they cast lots for my clothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>18	Be not far away, O LORD; *<br>
you are my strength; hasten to help me.<br>
19	Save me from the sword, *<br>
my life from the power of the dog.<br>
20	Save me from the lion&rsquo;s mouth, *<br>
my wretched body from the horns of wild bulls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21	I will declare your Name to my brethren; *<br>
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.<br>
22	Praise the LORD, you that fear him; *<br>
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;<br>
all you of Jacob&rsquo;s line, give glory.<br>
23	For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;<br>
neither does he hide his face from them; *<br>
but when they cry to him he hears them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>24	My praise is of him in the great assembly; *<br>
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who worship him.<br>
25	The poor shall eat and be satisfied,<br>
and those who seek the LORD shall praise him: *<br>
&ldquo;May your heart live for ever!&rdquo;<br>
26	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, *<br>
and all the families of the nations bow before him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>27	For kingship belongs to the LORD; *<br>
he rules over the nations.<br>
28	To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow down in worship; *<br>
all who go down to the dust fall before him.<br>
29	My soul shall live for him;<br>
my descendants shall serve him; *<br>
they shall be known as the LORD&rsquo;S for ever.<br>
30	They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *<br>
the saving deeds that he has done.</p>
