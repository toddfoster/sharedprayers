<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.</p>
<p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, &ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs&ndash; in our own languages we hear them speaking about God&rsquo;s deeds of power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the last day of the festival, the great day, while Jesus was standing there, he cried out, &ldquo;Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, &lsquo;Out of the believer&rsquo;s heart shall flow rivers of living water.&rsquo;&rdquo; Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in him were to receive.</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
