<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Joel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the LORD your God;<br>
for he has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the later rain, as before.<br>
The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.<br>
I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust has eaten,<br>
the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent against you.<br>
You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you.<br>
And my people shall never again be put to shame.<br>
You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is no other.<br>
And my people shall never again be put to shame.<br>
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh;<br>
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.<br>
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will show portents in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes. Then everyone who calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the LORD has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls.</p>

<p><em>Te decet hymnus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	You are to be praised, O God, in Zion; *<br>
to you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem.<br>
<strong>2	To you that hear prayer shall all flesh come, *<br>
because of their transgressions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Our sins are stronger than we are, *<br>
but you will blot them out.<br>
<strong>4	Happy are they whom you choose<br>
and draw to your courts to dwell there! *<br>
they will be satisfied by the beauty of your house,<br>
by the holiness of your temple.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Awesome things will you show us in your righteousness,<br>
O God of our salvation, *<br>
O Hope of all the ends of the earth<br>
and of the seas that are far away.<br>
<strong>6	You make fast the mountains by your power; *<br>
they are girded about with might.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	You still the roaring of the seas, *<br>
the roaring of their waves,<br>
and the clamor of the peoples.<br>
<strong>8	Those who dwell at the ends of the earth will tremble at your marvelous signs; *<br>
you make the dawn and the dusk to sing for joy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	You visit the earth and water it abundantly;<br>
you make it very plenteous; *<br>
the river of God is full of water.<br>
<strong>10	You prepare the grain, *<br>
for so you provide for the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	You drench the furrows and smooth out the ridges; *<br>
with heavy rain you soften the ground and bless its increase.<br>
<strong>12	You crown the year with your goodness, *<br>
and your paths overflow with plenty.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	May the fields of the wilderness be rich for grazing, *<br>
and the hills be clothed with joy.<br>
<strong>14	May the meadows cover themselves with flocks,<br>
and the valleys cloak themselves with grain; *<br>
let them shout for joy and sing.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</p>
<p>At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them! But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion&rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt: &ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, &lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.&rsquo; But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&rsquo; I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>
