<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>With Paul and Silas, we came to Philippi in Macedonia, a Roman colony, and, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling. While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, &ldquo;These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation.&rdquo; She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &ldquo;I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&rdquo; And it came out that very hour.</p>
<p>But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, &ldquo;These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe.&rdquo; The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods. After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely. Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>
<p>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were unfastened. When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul shouted in a loud voice, &ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&rdquo; The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them outside and said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay. He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1	The LORD is King;<br>
let the earth rejoice; *<br>
let the multitude of the isles be glad.<br>
<strong>2	Clouds and darkness are round about him, *<br>
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3	A fire goes before him *<br>
and burns up his enemies on every side.<br>
<strong>4	His lightnings light up the world; *<br>
the earth sees it and is afraid.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, *<br>
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br>

and all the peoples see his glory.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7	Confounded be all who worship carved images<br>
and delight in false gods! *<br>
Bow down before him, all you gods.<br>
<strong>8	Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *<br>
because of your judgments, O LORD.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	For you are the LORD,<br>
most high over all the earth; *<br>
you are exalted far above all gods.<br>
<strong>10	The LORD loves those who hate evil; *<br>
he preserves the lives of his saints<br>
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Light has sprung up for the righteous, *<br>
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.<br>
<strong>12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *<br>
and give thanks to his holy Name.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>At the end of the visions I, John, heard these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone&rsquo;s work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And let everyone who hears say, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one who testifies to these things says, &ldquo;Surely I am coming soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed for his disciples, and then he said. &ldquo;I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become completely one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that those also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory, which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you; and these know that you have sent me. I made your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
