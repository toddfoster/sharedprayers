<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the LORD.</p>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: &ldquo;The LORD is our righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
<strong>He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>

holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
<strong>To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>

<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</p>

<p>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. Then Jesus said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; And they cast lots to divide his clothing. The people stood by, watching Jesus on the cross; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!&rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, and saying, &ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, &ldquo;Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!&rdquo; But the other rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
We know that Christ is raised and dies no more.<br>
Embraced by death he broke its fearful hold;<br>
and our despair he turned to blazing joy.<br>
Alleluia!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
We share by water in his saving death.<br>
Reborn we share with him an Easter life<br>
as living members of a living Christ.<br>
Alleluia!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
The Father&rsquo;s splendor clothes the Son with life.<br>
The Spirit&rsquo;s power shakes the Church of God.<br>
Baptized we live with God the Three in One.<br>
Alleluia!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
A new creation comes to life and grows<br>
as Christ&rsquo;s new body takes on flesh and blood.<br>
The universe restored and whole will sing:<br>
Alleluia! Amen.</p></blockquote>
