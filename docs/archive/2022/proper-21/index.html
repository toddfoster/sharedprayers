<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_jeremiah-321-3a6-15_">The First Lesson: <em>Jeremiah 32:1-3a,6-15</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah, where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him.</p>
<p>Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me: Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, &ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.&rdquo; Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, &ldquo;Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.&rdquo; Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>And I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy; and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. In their presence I charged Baruch, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-timothy-66-19_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Timothy 6:6-19</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>There is great gain in godliness combined with contentment; for we brought nothing into the world, so that we can take nothing out of it; but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.</p>
<p>But as for you, man of God, shun all this; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will bring about at the right time&ndash; he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords. It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see; to him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</p>
<p>As for those who in the present age are rich, command them not to be haughty, or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, generous, and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life that really is life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
Glorious things of thee are spoken,<br>
Zion, city of our God;<br>
he whose word cannot be broken<br>
formed thee for his own abode;<br>
on the Rock of Ages founded,<br>
what can shake thy sure repose?<br>
With salvation&rsquo;s walls surrounded,<br>
thou may&rsquo;st smile at all thy foes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
See! the streams of living waters,<br>
springing from eternal love,<br>
well supply thy sons and daughters<br>
and all fear of want remove.<br>
Who can faint, when such a river<br>
ever flows their thirst to assuage?<br>
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,<br>
never fails from age to age.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
Round each habitation hovering,<br>
see the cloud and fire appear<br>
for a glory and a covering,<br>
showing that the Lord is near.<br>
Thus deriving from their banner,<br>
light by night, and shade by day;<br>
safe they feed upon the manna<br>
which he gives them when they pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4<br>
Blest inhabitants of Zion,<br>
washed in the Redeemer&rsquo;s blood!<br>
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,<br>
makes them kings and priests to God.<br>
&lsquo;Tis his love his people raises<br>
over self to reign as kings:<br>
and as priests, his solemn praises<br>
each for a thank-offering brings.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores. The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side. He called out, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.&rsquo; But Abraham said, &lsquo;Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony. Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father&rsquo;s house&ndash; for I have five brothers&ndash; that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.&rsquo; Abraham replied, &lsquo;They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
