<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Amos.</p>
<p>This is what the Lord GOD showed me&ndash; a basket of summer fruit. He said, &ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;A basket of summer fruit.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by.<br>
The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,&rdquo; says the Lord GOD;<br>
&ldquo;the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!&rdquo;<br>
Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land,<br>
saying, &ldquo;When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain;<br>
and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?<br>
We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances,<br>
buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat.&rdquo;<br>
The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob:<br>
Surely I will never forget any of their deeds.<br>
Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it,<br>
and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt?<br>
On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight.<br>
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation;<br>
I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head;<br>
I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.<br>
The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land;<br>
not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.<br>
They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east;<br>
they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.</p>

against the godly all day long?<br>
<strong>2	You plot ruin;<br>
your tongue is like a sharpened razor, *<br>
O worker of deception.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_colossians-115-28_">The Second Lesson: <em>Colossians 1:15-28</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers&ndash; all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</p>
<p>And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death, so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him&ndash; provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith, without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven. I, Paul, became a servant of this gospel.</p>
<p>I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ&rsquo;s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church. I became its servant according to God&rsquo;s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints. To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It is he whom we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.</p>

<p>As Jesus and his disciples went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and listened to what he was saying. But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, &ldquo;Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.&rdquo; But the Lord answered her, &ldquo;Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
