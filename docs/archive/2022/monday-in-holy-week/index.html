<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights;<br>
I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations.<br>
He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street;<br>
a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice.<br>
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.<br>
Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it,<br>
who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it:<br>
I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you;<br>
I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind,<br>
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.<br>
I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to idols.<br>
See, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare;<br>
before they spring forth, I tell you of them.</p>

and your faithfulness to the clouds.<br>
<strong>6 Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,<br>
your justice like the great deep; *<br>
you save both man and beast, O Lord.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 How priceless is your love, O God! *<br>
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.<br>
<strong>8 They feast upon the abundance of your house; *<br>
you give them drink from the river of your delights.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 For with you is the well of life, *<br>
and in your light we see light.<br>
<strong>10 Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *<br>
and your favor to those who are true of heart.</strong></p>

<p>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
