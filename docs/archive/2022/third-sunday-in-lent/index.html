<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_exodus-31-15_">The First Lesson: <em>Exodus 3:1-15</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.” When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p>
<p>Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”</p>
<p>But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, &lsquo;The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,&rsquo; and they ask me, &lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; what shall I say to them?” God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.'” God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, &lsquo;The LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you&rsquo;:</p>

<p>This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.”</p>

<p>1 O God, you are my God; eagerly I seek you; *<br>
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you,<br>
as in a barren and dry land where there is no water.<br>
<strong>2 Therefore I have gazed upon you in your holy place, *<br>
that I might behold your power and your glory.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 For your loving-kindness is better than life itself; *<br>
my lips shall give you praise.<br>
<strong>4 So will I bless you as long as I live *<br>
and lift up my hands in your Name.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 My soul is content, as with marrow and fatness, *<br>
and my mouth praises you with joyful lips,<br>
<strong>6 When I remember you upon my bed, *<br>
and meditate on you in the night watches.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_1-corinthians-101-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>1 Corinthians 10:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s first epistle to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, &ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.&rdquo; We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come. So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.</p>

<p>At that very time there were some present who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. He asked them, &ldquo;Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them&ndash;do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told this parable: &ldquo;A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said to the gardener, &lsquo;See here! For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should it be wasting the soil?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Sir, let it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

<p>1<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
I bind this day to me for ever,<br>
by power of faith, Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation;<br>
his baptism in the Jordan river;<br>
his death on cross for my salvation;<br>
his bursting from the spiced tomb;<br>
his riding up the heavenly way;<br>
his coming at the day of doom:<br>
I bind unto myself today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3<br>
I bind unto myself the power<br>
of the great love of cherubim;<br>
the sweet &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; in judgment hour;<br>
the service of the seraphim;<br>
confessors&rsquo; faith, apostles&rsquo; word,<br>
the patriarchs&rsquo; prayers, the prophets&rsquo; scrolls;<br>
all good deeds done unto the Lord,<br>
and purity of virgin souls.</p>

I bind unto myself today<br>
the virtues of the star-lit heaven<br>
the glorious sun&rsquo;s life-giving ray,<br>
the whiteness of the moon at even,<br>
the flashing of the lightning free,<br>
the whirling wind&rsquo;s tempestuous shocks,<br>
the stable earth, the deep salt sea,<br>
around the old eternal rocks.</p>

<p>5<br>
I bind unto myself today<br>
the power of God to hold and lead,<br>
his eye to watch, his might to stay,<br>
his ear to hearken, to my need;<br>
the wisdom of my God to teach,<br>
his hand to guide, his shield to ward;<br>
the word of God to give me speech,<br>
his heavenly host to be my guard.</p>

<p>6<br>
Christ be with me, Christ within me,<br>
Christ behind me, Christ before me,<br>
Christ beside me, Christ to win me,<br>
Christ to comfort and restore me,<br>
Christ beneath me, Christ above me,<br>
Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,<br>
Christ in hearts of all that love me,<br>
Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.</p>

<p>7<br>
I bind unto myself the Name,<br>
the strong Name of the Trinity,<br>
by invocation of the same,<br>
the Three in One, and One in Three.<br>
Of whom all nature hath creation,<br>
eternal Father, Spirit, Word:<br>
praise to the Lord of my salvation,<br>
salvation is of Christ the Lord.</p>
