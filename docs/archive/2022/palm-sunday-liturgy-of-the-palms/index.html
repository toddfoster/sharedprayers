<blockquote>
<p>After telling a parable to the crowd at Jericho, Jesus went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he had come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, saying, &ldquo;Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, &lsquo;Why are you untying it?&rsquo; just say this, &lsquo;The Lord needs it.'&rdquo; So those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, &ldquo;Why are you untying the colt?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;The Lord needs it.&rdquo; Then they brought it to Jesus; and after throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. As he rode along, people kept spreading their cloaks on the road. As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen, saying,</p>

<p>1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *<br>
his mercy endures for ever.</p>

and have become my salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<p>22 The same stone which the builders rejected *<br>
has become the chief cornerstone.</p>
<p>23 This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, *<br>
and it is marvelous in our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<p>24 On this day the Lord has acted; *<br>
we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p>25 Hosannah, Lord, hosannah! *<br>
Lord, send us now success.</p>
<p><strong>Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<p>26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; *<br>
we bless you from the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>27 God is the Lord; he has shined upon us; *<br>
form a procession with branches up to the horns of the altar.</p>
<p><strong>Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.</strong></p>
<p>28 &ldquo;You are my God, and I will thank you; *<br>
you are my God, and I will exalt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>29 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *<br>
his mercy endures for ever.</p>
