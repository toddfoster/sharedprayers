<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty waters,<br>
who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior;<br>
they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:<br>
Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old.<br>
I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?<br>
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.<br>
The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches;<br>
for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert,<br>
to give drink to my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself<br>
so that they might declare my praise.</p></blockquote>

<p>1	When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *<br>
then were we like those who dream.<br>
<strong>2	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *<br>
and our tongue with shouts of joy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Then they said among the nations, *<br>
&ldquo;The LORD has done great things for them.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4	The LORD has done great things for us, *<br>
and we are glad indeed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *<br>
like the watercourses of the Negev.<br>
<strong>6	Those who sowed with tears *<br>
will reap with songs of joy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *<br>
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-philippians-34b-14">The Second Lesson: <em>Philippians 3:4b-14</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</p>
<p>Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>

<p>1<br>
Surely it is God who saves me;<br>
trusting him, I shall not fear.<br>
For the Lord defends and shields me<br>
and his saving help is near.<br>
So rejoice as you draw water<br>
from salvation&rsquo;s living spring;<br>
in the day of your deliverance thank the Lord,<br>
his mercies sing.</p></blockquote>

<p>2<br>
Make his deeds known to the peoples;<br>
tell out his exalted Name.<br>
Praise the Lord, who has done great things;<br>
all his works his might proclaim.<br>
Zion, lift your voice in singing;<br>
for with you has come to dwell,<br>
in your very midst, the great and Holy<br>
One of Israel.</p></blockquote>
