<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&rdquo; The reply came, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&rdquo; [The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</p>
<p>Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo; The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&rdquo; But Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.&rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel; I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&rdquo; So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his strength.</p>
<p>For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, &ldquo;He is the Son of God.&quot;]</p>

<p>1	I will exalt you, O LORD, because you have lifted me <strong>up</strong> *<br>
and have not let my enemies triumph <strong>over me.</strong><br>
2	O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *<br>
and you restored me to <strong>health.</strong></p>
<p>3	You brought me up, O LORD, from the <strong>dead</strong>; *<br>
you restored my life as I was going down to the <strong>grave</strong>.<br>

<p>7	While I felt secure, I said, I shall never be dis - <strong>turbed</strong>. *<br>
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as the <strong>mountains</strong>.&rdquo;<br>
8	Then you hid your <strong>face</strong>, *<br>
and I was filled with <strong>fear</strong>.</p>
<p>9	I cried to you, O <strong>LORD</strong>; *<br>
I pleaded with the Lord, <strong>saying</strong>,<br>
10	&ldquo;What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the <strong>Pit</strong>? *<br>
will the dust praise you or declare your <strong>faithfulness</strong>?</p>
<p>11	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy up- <strong>on me</strong>; *<br>
O LORD, be my <strong>helper</strong>.&rdquo;<br>

<p>A reading from John’s Revelation.</p>
<p>I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, singing with full voice,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered<br>
to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might<br>
and honor and glory and blessing!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb<br>
be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the four living creatures said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; And the elders fell down and worshiped.</p>

<p>Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We will go with you.&rdquo; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p>Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, you have no fish, have you?&rdquo; They answered him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; because they knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<p>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo; A second time he said to him, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Tend my sheep.&rdquo; He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Simon son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed my sheep. Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.&rdquo; (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
