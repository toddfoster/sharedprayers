<h3 id="the-first-lesson-jeremiah-3127-34">The First Lesson: <em>Jeremiah 31:27-34</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals. And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD. In those days they shall no longer say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children&rsquo;s teeth are set on edge.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge.</p>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt&ndash; a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, &ldquo;Know the LORD,&rdquo; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.</p>

<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior, *<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old,<br>
that he would save us from our enemies, *<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers *<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, *<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God *<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>As for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it, and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work.</p>
<p>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly urge you: proclaim the message; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and encourage, with the utmost patience in teaching. For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry fully.</p>

<p><strong>You, Christ, are the king of glory,<br>

When you became man to set us free<br>
you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.<br>
You overcame the sting of death<br>
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br>
You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.<br>
We believe that you will come and be our judge.<br>
Come then, Lord, and help your people,<br>
bought with the price of your own blood,<br>
and bring us with your saints<br>

<p>A reading from Luke’s Gospel.</p>
<p>Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart. He said, &ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people. In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, &lsquo;Grant me justice against my opponent.&rsquo; For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, &lsquo;Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.&rsquo;&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;Listen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them? I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&rdquo;</p>
