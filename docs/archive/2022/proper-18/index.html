<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_jeremiah-181-11_">The First Lesson: <em>Jeremiah 18:1-11</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: &ldquo;Come, go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will let you hear my words.&rdquo; So I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there he was working at his wheel. The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&rsquo;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to me: Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the LORD. Just like the clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.</p>

<p><em>Domine, probasti</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *<br>
you know my sitting down and my rising up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.<br>
<strong>2	You trace my journeys and my resting-places *<br>
and are acquainted with all my ways.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *<br>
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.<br>
<strong>4	You press upon me behind and before *<br>
and lay your hand upon me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *<br>
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.<br>
<strong>12	For you yourself created my inmost parts; *<br>
you knit me together in my mother&rsquo;s womb.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13	I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *<br>
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.<br>
<strong>14	My body was not hidden from you, *<br>
while I was being made in secret<br>
and woven in the depths of the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;<br>
all of them were written in your book; *<br>
they were fashioned day by day,<br>
when as yet there was none of them.<br>
<strong>16	How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *<br>
how great is the sum of them!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *<br>
to count them all, my life span would need to<br>
be like yours.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_philemon-1-21_">The Second Lesson: <em>Philemon 1-21</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to Philemon.</p>
<p>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus. I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ. I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.</p>
<p>For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty, yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love&ndash; and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother&ndash; especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p>So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</p>

<p>Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus; and he turned and said to them, &ldquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, &lsquo;This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.&rsquo; Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
