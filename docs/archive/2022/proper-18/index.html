<h3 id="the-first-lesson-_jeremiah-181-11_">The First Lesson: <em>Jeremiah 18:1-11</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: &ldquo;Come, go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will let you hear my words.&rdquo; So I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there he was working at his wheel. The vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&rsquo;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as seemed good to him.</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to me: Can I not do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done? says the LORD. Just like the clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. At one moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, but if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the disaster that I intended to bring on it. And at another moment I may declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, but if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will change my mind about the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus says the LORD: Look, I am a potter shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, all of you from your evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.</p>

<h3 id="psalm-1391-512-17">Psalm 139:1-5,12-17</h3>
<p><em>Domine, probasti</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 LORD, you have searched me out and known me; *<br>
you know my sitting down and my rising up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.<br>
<strong>2 You trace my journeys and my resting-places *<br>
and are acquainted with all my ways.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Indeed, there is not a word on my lips, *<br>
but you, O LORD, know it altogether.<br>
<strong>4 You press upon me behind and before *<br>
and lay your hand upon me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; *<br>
it is so high that I cannot attain to it.<br>
<strong>12 For you yourself created my inmost parts; *<br>
you knit me together in my mother&rsquo;s womb.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 I will thank you because I am marvelously made; *<br>
your works are wonderful, and I know it well.<br>
<strong>14 My body was not hidden from you, *<br>
while I was being made in secret<br>
and woven in the depths of the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb;<br>
all of them were written in your book; *<br>
they were fashioned day by day,<br>
when as yet there was none of them.<br>
<strong>16 How deep I find your thoughts, O God! *<br>
how great is the sum of them!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17 If I were to count them, they would be more in number than the sand; *<br>
to count them all, my life span would need to be like yours.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_philemon-1-21_">The Second Lesson: <em>Philemon 1-21</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to Philemon.</p>
<p>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p>To Philemon our dear friend and co-worker, to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>When I remember you in my prayers, I always thank my God because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus. I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ. I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, my brother.</p>
<p>For this reason, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty, yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love&ndash; and I, Paul, do this as an old man, and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am appealing to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me. I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent, in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced. Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother&ndash; especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p>So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. I say nothing about your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, let me have this benefit from you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ. Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.</p>

<p>Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus; and he turned and said to them, &ldquo;Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, saying, `This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.&rsquo; Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace. So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Almighty and everliving God,<br>
we thank you for feeding us with the spiritual food<br>
of the most precious Body and Blood<br>
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ;<br>
and for assuring us in these holy mysteries<br>
that we are living members of the Body of your Son,<br>
and heirs of your eternal kingdom.<br>
And now, Father, send us out<br>
to do the work you have given us to do,<br>
to love and serve you<br>
as faithful witnesses of Christ our Lord.<br>
To him, to you, and to the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
