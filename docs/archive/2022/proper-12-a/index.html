for he is speaking peace to his faithful people<br>

<h3 id="the-first-lesson-hosea-12-10">The First Lesson: <em>Hosea 1:2-10</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Hosea.</p>
<p>When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, &ldquo;Go, take for yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD.&rdquo; So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</p>
<p>And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them. But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by horses, or by horsemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, &ldquo;You are not my people,&rdquo; it shall be said to them, &ldquo;Children of the living God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 15: The Song of Mary</strong> &ndash; <em>Magnificat</em> (Luke 1:46-55)</p>
<h5 id="all-2"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-colossians-26-1516-19">The Second Lesson: <em>Colossians 2:6-15,(16-19)</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Colossians.</p>
<p>As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
<p>See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority. In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ; when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead. And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses, erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p>[Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths. These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking, and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.]</p>

<p><strong>Canticle 17: The Song of Simeon</strong> &mdash; <em>Nunc Dimittis</em>  (Luke 2:29-32)</p>
<h5 id="all-3"><strong>All:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Lord, you now have set your servant free *<br>
to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-third-lesson-luke-111-13">The Third Lesson: <em>Luke 11:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-4">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Lukeâ€™s Gospel.</p>
<p>Jesus was praying in a certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;When you pray, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father, hallowed be your name.<br>
Your kingdom come.<br>
Give us each day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our sins,<br>
for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us.<br>
And do not bring us to the time of trial.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And he said to them, &ldquo;Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, &lsquo;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.&rsquo; And he answers from within, &lsquo;Do not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.&rsquo; I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish? Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&rdquo;</p>
