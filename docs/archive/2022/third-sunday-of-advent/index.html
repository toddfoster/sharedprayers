<blockquote>
<p>Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel!<br>
Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem!<br>
The LORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your enemies.<br>
The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear disaster no more.<br>
On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:<br>
Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak.<br>
The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory;<br>
he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in his love;<br>
he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.<br>
I will remove disaster from you, so that you will not bear reproach for it.<br>
I will deal with all your oppressors at that time.<br>
And I will save the lame and gather the outcast,<br>
and I will change their shame into praise and renown in all the earth.<br>
At that time I will bring you home, at the time when I gather you;<br>
for I will make you renowned and praised among all the peoples of the earth,<br>
when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says the LORD.</p></blockquote>

Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;</strong><br>

<p>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.

<p>John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our ancestor&rsquo;; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the crowds asked him, &ldquo;What then should we do?&rdquo; In reply he said to them, &ldquo;Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.&rdquo; Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, &ldquo;Teacher, what should we do?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you.&rdquo; Soldiers also asked him, &ldquo;And we, what should we do?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John answered all of them by saying, &ldquo;I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
