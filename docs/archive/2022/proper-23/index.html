<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
<p>These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.</p>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.</p>

<h3 id="psalm-661-11">Psalm 66:1-11</h3>
<p><em>Jubilate Deo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Be joyful in God, all you lands; *<br>
sing the glory of his Name;<br>
sing the glory of his praise.<br>
<strong>2 Say to God, &ldquo;How awesome are your deeds! *<br>
because of your great strength your enemies cringe before you.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 All the earth bows down before you, *<br>
sings to you, sings out your Name.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4 Come now and see the works of God, *<br>
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 He turned the sea into dry land,<br>
so that they went through the water on foot, *<br>
and there we rejoiced in him.<br>
<strong>6 In his might he rules for ever;<br>
his eyes keep watch over the nations; *<br>
let no rebel rise up against him.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 Bless our God, you peoples; *<br>
make the voice of his praise to be heard;<br>
<strong>8 Who holds our souls in life, *<br>
and will not allow our feet to slip.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 For you, O God, have proved us; *<br>
you have tried us just as silver is tried.<br>
<strong>10 You brought us into the snare; *<br>
you laid heavy burdens upon our backs.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 You let enemies ride over our heads;<br>
we went through fire and water; *<br>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_2-timothy-28-15_">The Second Lesson: <em>2 Timothy 2:8-15</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to Timothy.</p>
<p>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David&ndash; that is my gospel, for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. The saying is sure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we have died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful&ndash; for he cannot deny himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth.</p>

<h5 id="deacon-1">Deacon:</h5>
<p>On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee. As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance, they called out, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&rdquo; When he saw them, he said to them, &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; And as they went, they were made clean. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus&rsquo; feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, &ldquo;Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?&rdquo; Then he said to him, &ldquo;Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

maker of heaven and earth,<br>
of all that is, seen and unseen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>
the only Son of God,<br>

God from God,<br>
Light from Light, true God from true God,<br>
begotten, not made,<br>
of one Being with the Father.<br>
Through him all things were made.<br>
For us and for our salvation<br>
he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</strong></p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
