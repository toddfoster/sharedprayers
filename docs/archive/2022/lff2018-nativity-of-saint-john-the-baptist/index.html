<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.<br>
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her<br>
that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid,<br>
that she has received from the LORD&rsquo;s hand double for all her sins.<br>
A voice cries out:<br>
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.<br>
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low;<br>
the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.<br>
Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”<br>
A voice says, “Cry out!” And I said, “What shall I cry?”<br>
All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand for ever.<br>
Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings;<br>
lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear;<br>
say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”<br>
See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him;<br>
his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.<br>
He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms,<br>
and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.</p>

you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.<br>
<strong>2	You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *<br>
and blotted out all their sins.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	You have withdrawn all your fury *<br>
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.<br>
<strong>4	Restore us then, O God our Savior; *<br>
let your anger depart from us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	Will you be displeased with us for ever? *<br>
will you prolong your anger from age to age?<br>
<strong>6	Will you not give us life again, *<br>
that your people may rejoice in you?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Show us your mercy, O LORD, *<br>

<strong>8	I will listen to what the LORD God is saying, *<br>
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people<br>
and to those who turn their hearts to him.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *<br>
that his glory may dwell in our land.<br>
<strong>10	Mercy and truth have met together; *<br>
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	Truth shall spring up from the earth, *<br>
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.<br>
<strong>12	The LORD will indeed grant prosperity, *<br>
and our land will yield its increase.</strong></p>

<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>On the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”</p>
<p>So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak: “You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years. When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’ Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised; before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.”</p>
<p>“My brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.”</p>

<p>The time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father. But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.” They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.” Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him. He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God. Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea. All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
<p>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has looked favourably on his people and redeemed them.<br>
He has raised up a mighty saviour for us in the house of his servant David,<br>
as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, that we would be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us.<br>
Thus he has shown the mercy promised to our ancestors, and has remembered his holy covenant,<br>
the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham, to grant us that we, being rescued from the hands of our enemies,<br>
might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.”<br>
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,<br>
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us,<br>
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel.</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
