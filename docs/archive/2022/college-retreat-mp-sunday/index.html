<p>1	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; *<br>
his mercy endures for ever.<br>
<strong>2	Let Israel now proclaim, *<br>
&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;</strong></p>

&ldquo;His mercy endures for ever.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	I called to the LORD in my distress; *<br>
the LORD answered by setting me free.<br>
<strong>6	The LORD is at my side, therefore I will not fear; *<br>
what can anyone do to me?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The LORD is at my side to help me; *<br>
I will triumph over those who hate me.<br>
<strong>8	It is better to rely on the LORD *<br>
than to put any trust in flesh.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9	It is better to rely on the LORD *<br>
than to put any trust in rulers.<br>
<strong>10	All the ungodly encompass me; *<br>
in the Name of the LORD I will repel them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11	They hem me in, they hem me in on every side; *<br>
in the name of the LORD I will repel them.<br>

they blaze like a fire of thorns; *<br>
in the name of the LORD I will repel them.</strong></p>

but the LORD came to my help.<br>
<strong>14	The LORD is my strength and my song, *<br>
and he has become my salvation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15	There is a sound of exultation and victory *<br>
in the tents of the righteous:<br>
<strong>16	&ldquo;The right hand of the LORD has triumphed! *<br>
the right hand of the LORD is exalted!<br>
the right hand of the LORD has triumphed!&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17	I shall not die, but live, *<br>
and declare the works of the LORD.<br>
<strong>18	The LORD has punished me sorely, *<br>
but he did not hand me over to death.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19	Open for me the gates of righteousness; *<br>
I will enter them;<br>
I will offer thanks to the LORD.<br>

has become the chief cornerstone.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23	This is the LORD&rsquo;S doing, *<br>
and it is marvelous in our eyes.<br>
<strong>24	On this day the LORD has acted; *<br>
we will rejoice and be glad in it.</strong></p>

<p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion!<br>
Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem!<br>
Lo, your king comes to you;<br>
triumphant and victorious is he,<br>
humble and riding on a donkey,<br>
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.<br>
He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim<br>
and the warhorse from Jerusalem;<br>
and the battle-bow shall be cut off,<br>
and he shall command peace to the nations;<br>
his dominion shall be from sea to sea,<br>
and from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you,<br>
I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.<br>
Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;<br>
today I declare that I will restore to you double.<br>
For I have bent Judah as my bow;<br>
I have made Ephraim its arrow.<br>
I will arouse your sons, O Zion,<br>
against your sons, O Greece,<br>
and wield you like a warrior’s sword.</p>
<p>Then the Lord will appear over them,<br>
and his arrow go forth like lightning;<br>
the Lord God will sound the trumpet<br>
and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.<br>
The Lord of hosts will protect them,<br>
and they shall devour and tread down the slingers;<br>
they shall drink their blood like wine,<br>
and be full like a bowl,<br>
drenched like the corners of the altar.</p>
<p>On that day the Lord their God will save them,<br>
for they are the flock of his people;<br>
for like the jewels of a crown<br>
they shall shine on his land.</p>

<h3 id="the-second-lesson-_matthew-211-13_">The Second Lesson: <em>Matthew 21:1-13</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Matthew’s Gospel.</p>
<p>When they had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, ‘Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, “The Lord needs them.” And he will send them immediately.’ This took place to fulfil what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p>‘Tell the daughter of Zion,<br>
Look, your king is coming to you,<br>
humble, and mounted on a donkey,<br>
and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’</p>
<p>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,</p>
<p>‘Hosanna to the Son of David!<br>
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!<br>
Hosanna in the highest heaven!’</p>
<p>When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, ‘Who is this?’ The crowds were saying, ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.’</p>
<p>Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves. He said to them, ‘It is written,</p>
<p>“My house shall be called a house of prayer”;<br>
but you are making it a den of robbers.’</p>
