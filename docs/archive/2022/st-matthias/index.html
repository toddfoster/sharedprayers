<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Peter stood up among the believers (together the crowd numbered about one hundred twenty persons) and said, &ldquo;Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus&ndash; for he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.&rdquo; (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) &ldquo;For it is written in the book of Psalms,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it&rsquo;;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let another take his position of overseer.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us&ndash; one of these must become a witness with us to his resurrection.&rdquo; So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, &ldquo;Lord, you know everyone&rsquo;s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.&rdquo; And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1	LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *<br>
who may abide upon your holy hill?<br>
<strong>2	Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *<br>
who speaks the truth from his heart.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	There is no guile upon his tongue;<br>
he does no evil to his friend; *<br>
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.<br>
<strong>4	In his sight the wicked is rejected, *<br>
but he honors those who fear the LORD.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	He has sworn to do no wrong *<br>
and does not take back his word.<br>
<strong>6	He does not give his money in hope of gain, *<br>
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	Whoever does these things *<br>
shall never be overthrown.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-second-lesson-philippians-313-21">The Second Lesson: <em>Philippians 3:13-21</em></h3>
<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s epistle to the church in Phillipi.</p>
<p>This one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you. Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.</p>

<p>Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower. Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&rsquo;s commandments and abide in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.</p>
<p>“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.”</p>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion:</strong></p>
<p><em>We will be offering communion with both Christ’s Body and Blood. The consensus of public health studies to date show that there is no documentable risk of COVID19 transmission through the common cup. We understand individuals may have different comfort levels as to how they receive communion. Following the teaching of our Episcopal tradition, all persons may, but no person must, receive communion in both kinds to receive the full spiritual benefits of communion. You may choose to receive only the host at this time. Should you choose to receive the wine, one vessel will be offered for those who want to sip the wine from the common cup. Another vessel will be offered for those who wish to intinct (the host dipped in the wine).</em> (source: The Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey&rsquo;s Revised Guidelines for Communion in Both Kinds)</p>
<p><em>If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth.</em> (BCP, 457)</p>

<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p>

All are welcome to receive at Christ&rsquo;s table. If you would prefer to receive a verbal blessing instead of communion, cross your arms over your chest to indicate this.</h5>
