<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am about to create new heavens and a new earth;<br>
the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.<br>
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating;<br>
for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight.<br>
I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people;<br>
no more shall the sound of weeping be heard in it, or the cry of distress.<br>
No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old person who does not live out a lifetime;<br>
for one who dies at a hundred years will be considered a youth, and one who falls short of a hundred will be considered accursed.<br>
They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br>
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;<br>
for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br>
They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity;<br>
for they shall be offspring blessed by the Lord&ndash; and their descendants as well.<br>
Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.<br>
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent&ndash; its food shall be dust!<br>
They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord.</p>

<h5 id="lector-2">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, and we did not eat anyone&rsquo;s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you. This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.</p>

<p>When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, Jesus said, &ldquo;As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They asked him, &ldquo;Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, <code>I am he!' and, </code>The time is near!&rsquo; Do not go after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. This will give you an opportunity to testify. So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance; for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of my name. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We believe in one God,<br>

he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>

<p>We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world. In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.</p>
<p>On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.” After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>Therefore, according to his command, O Father,</p>
<h5 id="celebrant-and-people-1">Celebrant and <em>People</em></h5>
<p><strong>We remember his death,<br>

<p>And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.</p>
<p>We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to that heavenly country where, with  blessed Thomas, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all your saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our salvation.</p>
