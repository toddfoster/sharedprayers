<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Isaiah 40:1-11</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Comfort, O comfort my people,<br>
says your God.<br>
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,<br>
and cry to her<br>
that she has served her term,<br>
that her penalty is paid,<br>
that she has received from the Lord&rsquo;s hand<br>
double for all her sins.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A voice cries out:<br>
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord,<br>
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.<br>
Every valley shall be lifted up,<br>
and every mountain and hill be made low;<br>
the uneven ground shall become level,<br>
and the rough places a plain.<br>
Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,<br>
and all people shall see it together,<br>
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A voice says, “Cry out!”<br>
And I said, “What shall I cry?”<br>
All people are grass,<br>
their constancy is like the flower of the field.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>
when the breath of the Lord blows upon it;<br>
surely the people are grass.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades;<br>
but the word of our God will stand for ever.<br>
Get you up to a high mountain,<br>
O Zion, herald of good tidings;<br>
lift up your voice with strength,<br>
O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings,<br>
lift it up, do not fear;<br>
say to the cities of Judah,<br>
“Here is your God!”<br>
See, the Lord God comes with might,<br>
and his arm rules for him;<br>
his reward is with him,<br>
and his recompense before him.<br>
He will feed his flock like a shepherd;<br>
he will gather the lambs in his arms,<br>
and carry them in his bosom,<br>
and gently lead the mother sheep.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 85:1-2, 8-13<br>
<em>Benedixisti, Domine</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 You have been gracious to your land, O Lord, *<br>
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.<br>
<strong>2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *<br>
and blotted out all their sins.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8 I will listen to what the Lord God is saying, *<br>
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people<br>
and to those who turn their hearts to him.<br>
<strong>9 Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *<br>
that his glory may dwell in our land.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10 Mercy and truth have met together; *<br>
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<br>
<strong>11 Truth shall spring up from the earth, *<br>
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>12 The Lord will indeed grant prosperity, *<br>
and our land will yield its increase.<br>
<strong>13 Righteousness shall go before him, *<br>
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Peter 3:8-15a</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the second letter of Peter.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire? But, in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish; and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,<br>
who will prepare your way;<br>
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:<br>
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,<br>
make his paths straight,’”</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em></p></blockquote>
