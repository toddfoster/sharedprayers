<p><strong>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; *<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>

Free to worship him without fear, *<br>
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, *<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
To give his people knowledge of salvation *<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>

the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, *<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</strong></p>
