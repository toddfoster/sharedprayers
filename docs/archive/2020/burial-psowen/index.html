<blockquote>
<p>I am Resurrection and I am Life, says the Lord.<br>
Whoever has faith in me shall have life,<br>
even though he die.<br>
And everyone who has life,<br>
and has committed himself to me in faith,<br>
shall not die for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives<br>
and that at the last he will stand upon the earth.<br>
After my awaking, he will raise me up;<br>
and in my body I shall see God.<br>
I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him<br>
who is my friend and not a stranger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For none of us has life in himself,<br>
and none becomes his own master when he dies.<br>
For if we have life, we are alive in the Lord,<br>
and if we die, we die in the Lord.<br>
So, then, whether we live or die,<br>
we are the Lord’s possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="officiant">Officiant:</h5>
<p>The Lord be with you.</p>
<h5 id="people"><strong>People:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>And also with you.</strong></p>
<h5 id="officiant-1">Officiant:</h5>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<p>Officiant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, who by the glorious resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ destroyed death, and brought life and immortality to light: Grant that your servant Pat, being raised with him, may know the strength of his presence, and rejoice in his eternal glory; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="we-hear-gods-word">We Hear God’s Word</h2>
<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong>	&mdash; <em>2 Corinthians 4.16-5.9 NRSV</em><br>
Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from second Corinthians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure, because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.</p>
<p>For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling— if indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan under our burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</p>
<p>So we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord— for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalm 23</strong> &mdash; <em>Dominus regit me</em> &mdash; <em>(BCP 612)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lord is my shepherd; *<br>
I shall not be in want.<br>
He makes me lie down in green pastures *<br>
and leads me beside still waters.<br>
He revives my soul *<br>
and guides me along right pathways for his Name’s sake.<br>
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br>
I shall fear no evil; *<br>
for you are with me;<br>
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.<br>
You spread a table before me<br>
in the presence of those who trouble me; *<br>
you have anointed my head with oil,<br>
and my cup is running over.<br>
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me<br>
all the days of my life, *<br>
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</strong></p>
