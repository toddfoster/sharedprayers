<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>2 Samuel 7:1-11, 16</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from second Samuel.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the king was settled in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, &ldquo;See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent.&rdquo; Nathan said to the king, &ldquo;Go, do all that you have in mind; for the Lord is with you.&rdquo;<br>
But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan: Go and tell my servant David: Thus says the Lord: Are you the one to build me a house to live in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent and a tabernacle. Wherever I have moved about among all the people of Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the tribal leaders of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, &ldquo;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&rdquo; Now therefore thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Psalm</strong> 89:1-4, 19-26<br>
<em>Misericordias Domini</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Your love, O Lord, for ever will I sing; *<br>
from age to age my mouth will proclaim your faithfulness.<br>
<strong>2 For I am persuaded that your love is established for ever; *<br>
you have set your faithfulness firmly in the heavens.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; *<br>
I have sworn an oath to David my servant:<br>
<strong>4 ‘I will establish your line for ever, *<br>
and preserve your throne for all generations.’”</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>19 You spoke once in a vision and said to your faithful people: *<br>
“I have set the crown upon a warrior<br>
and have exalted one chosen out of the people.<br>
<strong>20 I have found David my servant; *<br>
with my holy oil have I anointed him.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>21 My hand will hold him fast *<br>
and my arm will make him strong.<br>
<strong>22 No enemy shall deceive him, *<br>
nor any wicked man bring him down.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>23 I will crush his foes before him *<br>
and strike down those who hate him.<br>
<strong>24 My faithfulness and love shall be with him, *<br>
and he shall be victorious through my Name.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>25 I shall make his dominion extend *<br>
from the Great Sea to the River.<br>
<strong>26 He will say to me, ‘You are my Father, *<br>
my God, and the rock of my salvation.’</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>

<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Luke.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p></blockquote>

<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.</p>
<p>On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prayer-for-spiritual-communion">Prayer for Spiritual Communion</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em><br>
(from <em>The Prayer Book for the Armed Services</em>)</p></blockquote>
