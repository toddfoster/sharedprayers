<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Leviticus 19:1-2,15-18</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Leviticus.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p>Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them: You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.</p>
<p>You shall not render an unjust judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great: with justice you shall judge your neighbor. You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not profit by the blood of your neighbor: I am the Lord.</p>
<p>You shall not hate in your heart anyone of your kin; you shall reprove your neighbor, or you will incur guilt yourself. You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 90:1-6, 13-17<br>
<em>Domine, refugium</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Lord, you have been our refuge *<br>
from one generation to another.<br>
<strong>2 Before the mountains were brought forth,<br>
or the land and the earth were born, *<br>
from age to age you are God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 You turn us back to the dust and say, *<br>
&ldquo;Go back, O child of earth.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>4 For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past *<br>
and like a watch in the night.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 You sweep us away like a dream; *<br>
we fade away suddenly like the grass.<br>
<strong>6 In the morning it is green and flourishes; *<br>
in the evening it is dried up and withered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 Return, O Lord; how long will you tarry? *<br>
be gracious to your servants.<br>
<strong>14 Satisfy us by your loving-kindness in the morning; *<br>
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>15 Make us glad by the measure of the days that you afflicted us *<br>
and the years in which we suffered adversity.<br>
<strong>16 Show your servants your works *<br>
and your splendor to their children.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Thessalonians 2:1-8</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the first letter to the Thessalonians:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you was not in vain, but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition. For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery, but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel, even so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please God who tests our hearts. As you know and as God is our witness, we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed; nor did we seek praise from mortals, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children. So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you have become very dear to us.</p>

<p><strong>The Holy Gospel</strong><br>
<em>Matthew 22:34-46</em></p>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” He said to him, “’You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”</p>
<p>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question: “What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.” He said to them, “How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The Lord said to my Lord,<br>
“Sit at my right hand,<br>
until I put your enemies under your feet”’?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If David thus calls him Lord, how can he be his son?” No one was able to give him an answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>

<p><strong>Almighty God, we thank you that in your great love you have fed us with the spiritual food and drink of the Body and Blood of your Son Jesus Christ, and have given us a foretaste of your heavenly banquet. Grant that this Sacrament may be to us a comfort in affliction, and a pledge of our inheritance in that kingdom where there is no death, neither sorrow nor crying, but the fullness of joy with all your saints; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.</strong></p>
