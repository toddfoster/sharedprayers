<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong> <em>Deuteronomy 8.7–18</em><br>
Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>Moses said to all Israel: For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with flowing streams, with springs and underground waters welling up in valleys and hills, a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey, a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper. You shall eat your fill and bless the Lord your God for the good land that he has given you.</p>
<p>Take care that you do not forget the Lord your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today. When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them, and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock, and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good. Do not say to yourself, &ldquo;My power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth.&rdquo; But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 65<br>
<em>Te decet hymnus</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 You are to be praised, O God, in Zion; *<br>
to you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem.<br>
<strong>2 To you that hear prayer shall all flesh come, *<br>
because of their transgressions.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Our sins are stronger than we are, *<br>
but you will blot them out.<br>
<strong>4 Happy are they whom you choose<br>
and draw to your courts to dwell there! *<br>
they will be satisfied by the beauty of your house,<br>
by the holiness of your temple.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Awesome things will you show us in your righteousness,<br>
O God of our salvation, *<br>
O Hope of all the ends of the earth<br>
and of the seas that are far away.<br>
<strong>6 You make fast the mountains by your power; *<br>
they are girded about with might.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 You still the roaring of the seas, *<br>
the roaring of their waves, and the clamor of the peoples.<br>
<strong>8 Those who dwell at the ends of the earth will tremble at your marvelous signs; *<br>
you make the dawn and the dusk to sing for joy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 You visit the earth and water it abundantly; you make it very plenteous; *<br>
the river of God is full of water.<br>
<strong>10 You prepare the grain, *<br>
for so you provide for the earth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11 You drench the furrows and smooth out the ridges; *<br>
with heavy rain you soften the ground and bless its increase.<br>
<strong>12 You crown the year with your goodness, *<br>
and your paths overflow with plenty.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>13 May the fields of the wilderness be rich for grazing, *<br>
and the hills be clothed with joy.<br>
<strong>14 May the meadows cover themselves with flocks,<br>
and the valleys cloak themselves with grain; *<br>
let them shout for joy and sing.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong> <em>2 Corinthians 9:6-15</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the second letter to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that by always having enough of everything, you may share abundantly in every good work. As it is written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor;<br>
his righteousness endures forever.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for your great generosity, which will produce thanksgiving to God through us; for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God. Through the testing of this ministry you glorify God by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others, while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God that he has given you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</p>

<p>Deacon:</p>

<p>On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee. As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance, they called out, saying, &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&rdquo; When he saw them, he said to them, &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests.&rdquo; And as they went, they were made clean. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. He prostrated himself at Jesus&rsquo; feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus asked, &ldquo;Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they? Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?&rdquo; Then he said to him, &ldquo;Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>

Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em></p></blockquote>
