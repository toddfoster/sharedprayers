<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong><br>
<em>Exodus  32:1-14</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from Exodus.</p>
<p>Moses said to the Lord, “See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’ Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.” He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” And he said to him, “If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here. For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>The Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The Lord’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.” And the Lord continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 99<br>
<em>Dominus regnavit</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 The Lord is King; let the people tremble; *<br>
he is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth shake.<br>
<strong>2 The Lord is great in Zion; *<br>
he is high above all peoples.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Let them confess his Name, which is great and awesome; *<br>
he is the Holy One.<br>
<strong>4 &ldquo;O mighty King, lover of justice, you have established equity; *<br>
you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Proclaim the greatness of the Lord our God<br>
and fall down before his footstool; *<br>
he is the Holy One.<br>
<strong>6 Moses and Aaron among his priests,<br>
and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *<br>
they called upon the Lord, and he answered them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7 He spoke to them out of the pillar of cloud; *<br>
they kept his testimonies and the decree that he gave them.<br>
<strong>8 O Lord our God, you answered them indeed; *<br>
you were a God who forgave them,<br>
yet punished them for their evil deeds.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Proclaim the greatness of the Lord our God<br>
and worship him upon his holy hill; *<br>
for the Lord our God is the Holy One.</p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong><br>
<em>1 Thessalonians 1:1-10</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the first letter to the Thessalonians:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace.</p>
<p>We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers, constantly remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you, because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake. And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to speak about it. For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead&ndash; Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.</p>

<p><strong>Glory to you, Lord Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pharisees went and plotted to entrap Jesus in what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?” They answered, “The emperor’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>

I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em></p>
