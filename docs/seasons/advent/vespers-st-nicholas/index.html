<p>Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.

<h5 id="lector">Lector:</h5>
<p>A reading from the first epistle of John.</p>
<p>Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.</p>
<p>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<p>People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, ‘Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.’ And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</p>
