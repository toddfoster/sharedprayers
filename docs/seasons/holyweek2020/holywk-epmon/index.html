<p><em>Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you.

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>

<h2 id="the-lessons">The Lessons</h2>
<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>Isaiah 42:1&ndash;9 NRSV</em><br>
Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my servant, whom I uphold,<br>
my chosen, in whom my soul delights;</p>
<p>I have put my spirit upon him;<br>
he will bring forth justice to the nations.</p>
<p>He will not cry or lift up his voice,<br>
or make it heard in the street;</p>
<p>a bruised reed he will not break,<br>
and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;<br>
he will faithfully bring forth justice.</p>
<p>He will not grow faint or be crushed<br>
until he has established justice in the earth;<br>
and the coastlands wait for his teaching.</p>
<p>Thus says God, the Lord,<br>
who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br>
who spread out the earth and what comes from it,</p>
<p>who gives breath to the people upon it<br>
and spirit to those who walk in it:</p>
<p>I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,<br>
I have taken you by the hand and kept you;</p>
<p>I have given you as a covenant to the people,<br>
a light to the nations,<br>
to open the eyes that are blind,</p>
<p>to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,<br>
from the prison those who sit in darkness.</p>
<p>I am the Lord, that is my name;<br>
my glory I give to no other,<br>
nor my praise to idols.</p>
<p>See, the former things have come to pass,<br>
and new things I now declare;</p>
<p>before they spring forth,<br>
I tell you of them.</p>

<p><strong>The Song of Mary</strong>	&mdash; <em>Magnificat</em> &mdash; <em>Luke 1:46-55</em><br>
<strong>All:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *<br>
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.<br>
From this day all generations will call me blessed: *<br>
the Almighty has done great things for me,<br>
and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm, *<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.<br>
Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>Hebrews 9:11&ndash;15 NRSV</em><br>
Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!</p>
<p>For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.</p>

to go in peace as you have promised;<br>
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>
A Light to enlighten the nations, *<br>
and the glory of your people Israel.<br>
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

<p><strong>The Third Lesson</strong> &mdash;  <em>John 12:1&ndash;11 NRSV</em><br>
Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, &ldquo;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?&rdquo; (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, &ldquo;Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.&rdquo; When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.</p>
