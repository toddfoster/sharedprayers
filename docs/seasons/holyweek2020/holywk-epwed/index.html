<p><em>Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you. There are three traditional roles in Evening Prayer: the officiant, the lector, and the people of God (everyone else). These roles can be combined or traded.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel; my heart teaches me, night after night.  I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.  <em>(Psalm 16:7,8)</em></p>

we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>

Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God has given me<br>
the tongue of a teacher,</p>
<p>that I may know how to sustain<br>
the weary with a word.</p>
<p>Morning by morning he wakens&ndash;<br>
wakens my ear<br>
to listen as those who are taught.</p>
<p>The Lord God has opened my ear,<br>
and I was not rebellious,<br>
I did not turn backward.</p>
<p>I gave my back to those who struck me,<br>
and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;</p>
<p>I did not hide my face<br>
from insult and spitting.</p>
<p>The Lord God helps me;<br>
therefore I have not been disgraced;</p>
<p>therefore I have set my face like flint,<br>
and I know that I shall not be put to shame;<br>
he who vindicates me is near.</p>
<p>Who will contend with me?<br>
Let us stand up together.</p>
<p>Who are my adversaries?<br>
Let them confront me.</p>
<p>It is the Lord God who helps me;<br>
who will declare me guilty?</p>

and holy is his Name.<br>
He has mercy on those who fear him *<br>
in every generation.<br>

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things, *<br>

The promise he made to our fathers, *<br>
to Abraham and his children for ever.<br>
Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br>

Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from the book of Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
<p>Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.</p>

For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *<br>
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:<br>

<p><strong>The Third Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>John 13:21-32 NRSV</em><br>
Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from John’s Gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, &ldquo;Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.&rdquo; The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples&ndash; the one whom Jesus loved&ndash; was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.&rdquo; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do quickly what you are going to do.&rdquo; Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, &ldquo;Buy what we need for the festival&rdquo;; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>
<p>When he had gone out, Jesus said, &ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once.&rdquo;</p>
