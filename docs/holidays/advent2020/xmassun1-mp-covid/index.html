<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the epistle to the Galatians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo; So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also an heir, through God.</p>

<p><strong>The Third Lesson</strong><br>
<em>John 1:1-18</em></p>
<p>Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br>
He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father&rsquo;s only son, full of grace and truth. (John testified to him and cried out, &ldquo;This was he of whom I said, &lsquo;He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.'&quot;) From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father&rsquo;s heart, who has made him known.</p>

but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.</strong></p>

<p><em>It Came Upon a Midnight Clear</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<br>
It came upon the midnight clear,<br>
that glorious song of old,<br>
from angels bending near the earth,<br>
to touch their harps of gold:<br>
&ldquo;Peace on the earth, good will to men,<br>
from heaven&rsquo;s all-gracious King.&rdquo;<br>
The world in solemn stillness lay,<br>
to hear the angels sing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2<br>
Still through the cloven skies they come<br>
with peaceful wings unfurled,<br>
and still their heavenly music floats<br>
o&rsquo;er all the weary world;<br>
above its sad and lowly plains<br>
bend on hovering wing,<br>
and ever o&rsquo;er its Babel sounds<br>
the blessed angels sing.</p>
