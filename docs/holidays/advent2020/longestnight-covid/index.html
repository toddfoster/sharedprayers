<h3 id="about-the-longest-night">About the Longest Night</h3>
<p>The <strong>winter solstice</strong> happens around 21 December every year. This is the longest night of the year, before the nights start getting shorter and the days longer. The Advent and Christmas seasons can feel like long, dark nights for those who find themselves out of step with the persistent and often artificial “cheer” of the season that assaults us from every side. The backdrop of traditions and cheeriness can remind us of our own losses and sadness. The added stresses of pandemic, politics, unrest, and visible injustice have added to our weight of sadness in 2020. The absence of the sun during this time of year doesn’t help either!</p>
<p>The <strong>Nativity of our Lord</strong> was a time for rejoicing, but it also involved much fear, sadness, anxiety, and terror. The Incarnation of our Lord meant that God in the flesh would experience the full range of human emotions, joining us in our mourning as well as in our joy.</p>
<p>The <strong>Longest Night Mass</strong> is intended to bring balance to our Advent and Christmas observances, making space for those emotions which don’t fit into the advertisers’ profit motive, but are very much a part of our lives. Sadness, emptiness, and even depression are valid, important emotions for Christians. They are God-given and correspond to the very real challenges and brokenness in our lives. You are welcome here.</p>

<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong> <em>Isaiah 40:1-8, 27-31</em><br>
Lector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p>Comfort, O comfort my people,<br>
says your God.<br>
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,<br>
and cry to her<br>
that she has served her term,<br>
that her penalty is paid,<br>
that she has received from the Lord’s hand<br>
double for all her sins.<br>
A voice cries out:<br>
‘In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord,<br>
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.<br>
Every valley shall be lifted up,<br>
and every mountain and hill be made low;<br>
the uneven ground shall become level,<br>
and the rough places a plain.<br>
Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,<br>
and all people shall see it together,<br>
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.’</p>
<p>A voice says, ‘Cry out!’<br>
And I said, ‘What shall I cry?’<br>
All people are grass,<br>
their constancy is like the flower of the field.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades,<br>
when the breath of the Lord blows upon it;<br>
surely the people are grass.<br>
The grass withers, the flower fades;<br>
but the word of our God will stand for ever.</p>
<p>Why do you say, O Jacob,<br>
and speak, O Israel,<br>
‘My way is hidden from the Lord,<br>
and my right is disregarded by my God’?<br>
Have you not known? Have you not heard?<br>
The Lord is the everlasting God,<br>
the Creator of the ends of the earth.<br>
He does not faint or grow weary;<br>
his understanding is unsearchable.<br>
He gives power to the faint,<br>
and strengthens the powerless.<br>
Even youths will faint and be weary,<br>
and the young will fall exhausted;<br>
but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength,<br>
they shall mount up with wings like eagles,<br>
they shall run and not be weary,<br>
they shall walk and not faint.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Psalm</strong> 121<br>
<em>Levavi oculos</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1	I lift up my eyes to the hills; *<br>
from where is my help to come?<br>
2	<strong>My help comes from the Lord, *<br>
the maker of heaven and earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3	He will not let your foot be moved *<br>
and he who watches over you will not fall asleep.<br>
4	<strong>Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel *<br>
shall neither slumber nor sleep;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5	The Lord himself watches over you; *<br>
the Lord is your shade at your right hand,<br>
6	<strong>So that the sun shall not strike you by day, *<br>
nor the moon by night.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7	The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; *<br>
it is he who shall keep you safe.<br>
8	<strong>The Lord shall watch over your going out and your coming in, *<br>
from this time forth for evermore.</strong></p>

When our disobedience took us far from you, you did not abandon us to the power of death. In your mercy you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find you. Again and again you called us into covenant with you, and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of time you sent your only Son to be our Savior. Incarnate by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of us, yet without sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy. To fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole creation new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise of your Name.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving Communion during Covid:</strong></p>
<p>Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.</p>
<p>If you wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)</li>
<li>Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.</li>
<li>Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish to receive communion physically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.</li>
<li>You are invited to utter the <em>Prayer for Spiritual Communion</em> while communion is being distributed.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In union, O Lord, with your faithful people at every altar of your Church, where the Holy Eucharist is now being celebrated, I desire to offer to you praise and thanksgiving. I remember your death, Lord Christ; I proclaim your resurrection; I await your coming in glory. Since I cannot receive you today in the Sacrament of your Body and Blood, I beseech you to come spiritually into my heart. Cleanse and strengthen me with your grace, Lord Jesus, and let me never be separated from you. May I live in you, and you in me, in this life and in the life to come. Amen.</em></p>
