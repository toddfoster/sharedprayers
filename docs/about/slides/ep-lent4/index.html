Officiant:
&gt; If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike. .smaller[_Psalm 139:10, 11_]


## Confession of Sin
Officiant:

&gt; Officiant and **People**:

&gt; **Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name. Amen.**

## The Psalm Appointed
##### The People are seated.
##### The Psalm is sung or said in a suitable manner (e.g., responsively by verse, in unison, or read by the lector).
**Psalm 107:1-3, 17-22**
_Confitemini Domino_

1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
**2 Let all those whom the Lord has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**

3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,  
	from the north and from the south.  
**17 Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; \*  
they were afflicted because of their sins.**

---
18 They abhorred all manner of food \*  
and drew near to death&#39;s door.  
**19 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.**

20 He sent forth his word and healed them \*  
and saved them from the grave.  
**21 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his mercy \*  
and the wonders he does for his children.**

22 Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving \*  
and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

## The Lessons
### The First Lesson
_Numbers 21:4-9_

Lector:

&gt; A reading from the book of Numbers.

&gt; From Mount Hor the Israelites set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; but the people became impatient on the way. The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. 


---
&gt; The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.” So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.

&gt; The word of the Lord.

**People:**

&gt; **Thanks be to God.**

##### Silence may be kept.

---
**Canticle 15**: The Song of Mary – _Magnificat_ .smaller[(Luke 1:46-55) (BCP 119)]

**All:**

&gt; **My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,  
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; \*  
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.  
From this day all generations will call me blessed: \*  
the Almighty has done great things for me,  
and holy is his Name.  
He has mercy on those who fear him \*  
in every generation.  
He has shown the strength of his arm, \*  
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.**

---
&gt; **He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, \*  
and has lifted up the lowly.  
He has filled the hungry with good things, \*  
and the rich he has sent away empty.  
He has come to the help of his servant Israel, \*  
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,  
The promise he made to our fathers, \*  
to Abraham and his children for ever.**

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

---
### The Second Lesson
_Ephesians 2:1-10_

Lector:

&gt; A reading from the epistle to the Ephesians.

&gt; You were dead through the trespasses and sins in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient. All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ-- by grace you have been saved-- and raised us up with him 

---
&gt; and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God-- not the result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.

&gt; The word of the Lord.

**People:**

&gt; **Thanks be to God.**

##### Silence may be kept.

---
**Canticle 17**: The Song of Simeon — _Nunc Dimittis_ .smaller[(Luke 2:29-32) (BCP 120)]

**All:**

&gt; **Lord, you now have set your servant free \*  
to go in peace as you have promised;  
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, \*  
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:  
A Light to enlighten the nations, \*  
and the glory of your people Israel.**

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

---
## The Third Lesson
_John 3:14-21_

Lector:

&gt; A reading from John’s Gospel.

&gt; Jesus said, “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

&gt; “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.

---
&gt; “Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed. But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”

&gt; The word of the Lord.

**People:**

&gt; **Thanks be to God.**

##### Silence may be kept. A brief homily, spiritual conversation, or moment of silence may be placed here.

## The Apostles&#39; Creed
Officiant and **People** together, all standing:

creator of heaven and earth.

and born of the Virgin Mary.  
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died, and was buried.  
He descended to the dead.  
On the third day he rose again.  
He ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.**

---
&gt; **I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of saints,  
the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and the life everlasting. Amen.**

&gt; The Lord be with you.

hallowed be thy Name,  
thy kingdom come,  
thy will be done,  
on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  
And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil.  
For thine is the kingdom,  
and the power,  
and the glory,  
for ever and ever. Amen.**
