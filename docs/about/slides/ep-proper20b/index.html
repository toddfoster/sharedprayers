 Officiant:
&gt; Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name. .smaller[_Amos 5:8_]


## Confession of Sin
Officiant:
&gt; Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.

##### The people kneel or stand as able. Silence may be kept.
---
&gt; Officiant and **People**:

&gt; **Most merciful God,  
we confess that we have sinned against you  
in thought, word, and deed,  
by what we have done,  
and by what we have left undone.  
We have not loved you with our whole heart;  
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.  
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.  
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,  
have mercy on us and forgive us;  
that we may delight in your will,  
and walk in your ways,  
to the glory of your Name. Amen.**

---
&gt; Priest:

&gt; Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in eternal life. Amen.

pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,

## The Psalm Appointed
##### The People are seated.
##### The Psalm is sung or said in a suitable manner (e.g., responsively by verse, in unison, or read by the lector).

**Psalm** 1
_Beatus vir qui non abiit_  
.smaller[_(BCP 585)_]

&gt; 1 Happy are they who have not walked  
in the counsel of the wicked, \*  
nor lingered in the way of sinners,  
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!  
**2 Their delight is in the law of the LORD, \*  
and they meditate on his law day and night.**

---
&gt; 3 They are like trees planted by streams of water,  
bearing fruit in due season,  
with leaves that do not wither; \*  
everything they do shall prosper.  
**4 It is not so with the wicked; \*  
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.**

&gt; 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when  
judgment comes, \*  
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.  
**6 For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, \*  
but the way of the wicked is doomed.**

&gt; **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**
