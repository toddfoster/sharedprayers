<p>A Reading from Matthew’s Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When they had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, ‘Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, “The Lord needs them.” And he will send them immediately.’ This took place to fulfil what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p><em>Tell the daughter of Zion,<br>
Look, your king is coming to you,<br>
humble, and mounted on a donkey,<br>
and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</em></p>
<p>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,</p>
<p><em>Hosanna to the Son of David!<br>
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!<br>
Hosanna in the highest heaven!</em></p>
<p>When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, ‘Who is this?’ The crowds were saying, ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.’ <em>(Matthew 21.1–11 NRSV)</em></p>

<p>It is right to praise you, Almighty God, for the acts of love by which you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. On this day he entered the holy city of Jerusalem in triumph, and was proclaimed as King of kings by those who spread their garments and branches of palm along his way. Let these branches be for us signs of his victory, and grant that we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our King, and follow him in the way that leads to eternal life; who lives and reigns in glory with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The First Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>Isaiah 50:4–9 NRSV</em></p>
<p>Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Reading from the book of Isaiah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord God has given me<br>
the tongue of a teacher,<br>
that I may know how to sustain<br>
the weary with a word.<br>
Morning by morning he wakens—<br>
wakens my ear<br>
to listen as those who are taught.<br>
The Lord God has opened my ear,<br>
and I was not rebellious,<br>
I did not turn backwards.<br>
I gave my back to those who struck me,<br>
and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;<br>
I did not hide my face<br>
from insult and spitting.<br>
The Lord God helps me;<br>
therefore I have not been disgraced;<br>
therefore I have set my face like flint,<br>
and I know that I shall not be put to shame;<br>
he who vindicates me is near.<br>
Who will contend with me?<br>
Let us stand up together.<br>
Who are my adversaries?<br>
Let them confront me.<br>
It is the Lord God who helps me;<br>
who will declare me guilty?<br>
All of them will wear out like a garment;<br>
the moth will eat them up.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 31.9–16</strong> &mdash; <em>In te, Domine, speravi</em> &mdash; <em>(BCP 623)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *<br>
my eye is consumed with sorrow,<br>
and also my throat and my belly.</p>
<p><strong>10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing; *<br>
my strength fails me because of affliction,<br>
and my bones are consumed.</strong></p>
<p>11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies<br>
and even to my neighbors,<br>
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *<br>
when they see me in the street they avoid me.</p>
<p><strong>12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *<br>
I am as useless as a broken pot.</strong></p>
<p>13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around; *<br>
they put their heads together against me;<br>
they plot to take my life.</p>
<p><strong>14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. *<br>
I have said, &ldquo;You are my God.</strong></p>
<p>15 My times are in your hand; *<br>
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,<br>
and from those who persecute me.</p>
<p><strong>16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *<br>
and in your loving-kindness save me.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Second Lesson</strong> &mdash; <em>Philippians 2:5–11</em></p>
<p>Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reading from the letter to the Philippians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,<br>
who, though he was in the form of God,<br>
did not regard equality with God<br>
as something to be exploited,<br>
but emptied himself,<br>
taking the form of a slave,<br>
being born in human likeness.</p>
<p>And being found in human form,<br>
he humbled himself<br>
and became obedient to the point of death—<br>
even death on a cross.</p>
<p>Therefore God also highly exalted him<br>
and gave him the name<br>
that is above every name,<br>
so that at the name of Jesus<br>
every knee should bend,<br>
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
and every tongue should confess<br>
that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
to the glory of God the Father.</p>
