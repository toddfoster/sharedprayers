##### Passing the Peace is primarily a liturgical practice, not a social one. While the threat of Covid-19 is prominent, the peace will be brief. Please do not move around or make contact (shaking hands, hugs) with others. Instead you are invited to look to the person on either side of you and wish them peace with a bow or a wave.

## The Great Thanksgiving: Eucharistic Prayer A
Presider:
> The Lord be with you.

**People:**
> **And also with you.**

Presider:
> Lift up your hearts.

**People:**
> **We lift them to the Lord.**

Presider:
> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**People:**
> **It is right to give God thanks and praise.**

The Presider continues:
> It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.

##### A Proper Preface may be used here.

> Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:

### Sanctus
**Presider and People:**
> **Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.**

The Presider continues:
> Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.

> He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.

> On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”

> After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”

Presider:
> Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:

**People:**
> **Christ has died.
Christ is risen.
Christ will come again.**

The Presider continues:
> We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.

> Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.

Presider:
> All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.

**People:**
> **AMEN.**

### The Lord's Prayer
Presider:
> And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,

> Alleluia. Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.

**People:**
> **Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia.**

Presider:
> The Gifts of God for the People of God.

## We Receive the Gift of God

**Receiving Communion during Covid:**

Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.

If you wish to receive communion physically:

1. Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)
2. Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.
3. Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.

If you do not wish to receive communion physically:

1. Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.
2. You are invited to utter the _Prayer for Spiritual Communion_ while communion is being distributed.

##### If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)

### The Post-communion Prayer
Presider:
> Let us pray.

**People:**
> **Eternal God, heavenly Father,
you have graciously accepted us as living members
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,
and you have fed us with spiritual food
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.
Send us now into the world in peace,
and grant us strength and courage
to love and serve you
with gladness and singleness of heart;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.**

### The Blessing

### The Dismissal
Deacon:
> Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

_In order to minimize the possibility of infecting others,
please exit the campus immediately._
