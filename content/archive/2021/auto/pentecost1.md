## Bell Tower Re-Dedication
### Introduction and Thanksgiving
### "Church Bells" by [Clara Ann Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Ann_Thompson)
### Reading of the Plaques of Dedication
### Prayer of Dedication

**People:**
> **Their sound has gone out into all lands,
and their message to the ends of the world.**

_Presider:_
> I call to you my people:

**People:**
> **My voice is to the children of God.**

_Presider:_
> Let us pray. (_Silence_)

> O God, accept our offering of this bell and tower, which we
re-dedicate to you today: Grant that in this generation and in
those that are to come, its voice may continually call your
people to praise and worship; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

**People:**
> **Amen.**
