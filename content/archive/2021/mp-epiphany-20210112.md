### Psalms 5, 6
##### The People are seated.
##### The Psalm is sung or said in a suitable manner (e.g., responsively by verse, in unison, or read by the lector).

**Psalm 5**
_Verba mea auribus_

> 1	Give ear to my words, O LORD; *
consider my meditation.
> **2	Hearken to my cry for help, my King and my God, *
for I make my prayer to you.**

> 3	In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; *
early in the morning I make my appeal and watch for you.
> **4	For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, *
and evil cannot dwell with you.**

> 5	Braggarts cannot stand in your sight; *
you hate all those who work wickedness.
> **6	You destroy those who speak lies; *
the bloodthirsty and deceitful, O LORD, you abhor.**

> 7	But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy I will
go into your house; *
I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.
> **8	Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness,
because of those who lie in wait for me; *
make your way straight before me.**

> 9	For there is no truth in their mouth; *
there is destruction in their heart;
> **10	Their throat is an open grave; *
they flatter with their tongue.**

> 11	Declare them guilty, O God; *
let them fall, because of their schemes.
> **12	Because of their many transgressions cast them out, *
for they have rebelled against you.**

> 13	But all who take refuge in you will be glad; *
they will sing out their joy for ever.
> **14	You will shelter them, *
so that those who love your Name may exult in you.**

> 15	For you, O LORD, will bless the righteous; *
you will defend them with your favor as with a shield.

**Psalm 6**
_Domine, ne in furore_

> 1	LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger; *
do not punish me in your wrath.
> **2	Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak; *
heal me, LORD, for my bones are racked.**

> 3	My spirit shakes with terror; *
how long, O LORD, how long?
> **4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver me; *
save me for your mercy's sake.**

> 5	For in death no one remembers you; *
and who will give you thanks in the grave?
> **6	I grow weary because of my groaning; *
every night I drench my bed**
and flood my couch with tears.

> 7	My eyes are wasted with grief *
and worn away because of all my enemies.
> **8	Depart from me, all evildoers, *
for the LORD has heard the soun**d of my weeping.

> 9	The LORD has heard my supplication; *
the LORD accepts my prayer.
> **10	All my enemies shall be confounded and quake with fear; *
they shall turn back and suddenly be put to shame.**

##### At the end of the Psalms is sung or said
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**

## The Lessons

### The First  Reading: _Isaiah 40:25--31_

Lector:
> A Reading from the prophet Isaiah.

> To whom then will you compare me,
   or who is my equal? says the Holy One.
Lift up your eyes on high and see:
   Who created these?
He who brings out their host and numbers them,
   calling them all by name;
because he is great in strength,
   mighty in power,
   not one is missing.

> Why do you say, O Jacob,
   and speak, O Israel,
‘My way is hidden from the Lord,
   and my right is disregarded by my God’?
Have you not known? Have you not heard?
The Lord is the everlasting God,
   the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He does not faint or grow weary;
   his understanding is unsearchable.
He gives power to the faint,
   and strengthens the powerless.
Even youths will faint and be weary,
   and the young will fall exhausted;
but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength,
   they shall mount up with wings like eagles,
they shall run and not be weary,
   they shall walk and not faint.

> The Word of the Lord.

*People:*
> *Thanks be to God.*

##### Silence may be kept.

### The Second  Reading: _Ephesians 1.15--23_
Lector:
> A Reading from the Epistle to the Ephesians

> I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love towards all the saints, and for this reason I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him, so that, with the eyes of your heart enlightened, you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his great power. God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.

### The Third  Reading: _Mark 1.14--28_

Lector:
> A Reading from Mark's Gospel

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God, and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.’

> As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake—for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, ‘Follow me and I will make you fish for people.’ And immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.

> They went to Capernaum; and when the sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and taught. They were astounded at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, ‘What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.’ But Jesus rebuked him, saying, ‘Be silent, and come out of him!’ And the unclean spirit, throwing him into convulsions and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. They were all amazed, and they kept on asking one another, ‘What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.’ At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.
