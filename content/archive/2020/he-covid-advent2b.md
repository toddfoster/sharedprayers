## We Hear God’s Word
**The First Lesson**
_Isaiah 40:1-11_

Lector:
> A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

> Comfort, O comfort my people,
says your God.
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
and cry to her
that she has served her term,
that her penalty is paid,
that she has received from the Lord's hand
double for all her sins.


> A voice cries out:
“In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord,
make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be lifted up,
and every mountain and hill be made low;
the uneven ground shall become level,
and the rough places a plain.
Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
and all people shall see it together,
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”


> A voice says, “Cry out!”
And I said, “What shall I cry?”
All people are grass,
their constancy is like the flower of the field.
The grass withers, the flower fades,
when the breath of the Lord blows upon it;
surely the people are grass.
The grass withers, the flower fades;
but the word of our God will stand for ever.
Get you up to a high mountain,
O Zion, herald of good tidings;
lift up your voice with strength,
O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings,
lift it up, do not fear;
say to the cities of Judah,
“Here is your God!”
See, the Lord God comes with might,
and his arm rules for him;
his reward is with him,
and his recompense before him.
He will feed his flock like a shepherd;
he will gather the lambs in his arms,
and carry them in his bosom,
and gently lead the mother sheep.

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**The Psalm** 85:1-2, 8-13
_Benedixisti, Domine_

> 1 You have been gracious to your land, O Lord, *
you have restored the good fortune of Jacob.
**2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people *
and blotted out all their sins.**

> 8 I will listen to what the Lord God is saying, *
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people
	and to those who turn their hearts to him.
**9 Truly, his salvation is very near to those who fear him, *
that his glory may dwell in our land.**

> 10 Mercy and truth have met together; *
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
**11 Truth shall spring up from the earth, *
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.**

> 12 The Lord will indeed grant prosperity, *
and our land will yield its increase.
**13 Righteousness shall go before him, *
and peace shall be a pathway for his feet.**


**The Second Lesson**
_2 Peter 3:8-15a_

Lector:
> A reading from the second letter of Peter.

> Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed.

> Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire? But, in accordance with his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.

> Therefore, beloved, while you are waiting for these things, strive to be found by him at peace, without spot or blemish; and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation.

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

##### The people stand as able.
**The Holy Gospel**
_Mark 1:1-8_

Deacon:
> The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Mark.

**People:**
> **Glory to you, Lord Christ.**

Deacon:

> The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

> As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,
>> “See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
who will prepare your way;
the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight,’”

> John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”


Deacon:
> The Gospel of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Praise to you, Lord Christ.**

##### Passing the Peace is primarily a liturgical practice, not a social one. While the threat of Covid-19 is prominent, the peace will be brief. Please do not move around or make contact (shaking hands, hugs) with others. Instead you are invited to look to the person on either side of you and wish them peace with a bow or a wave.

## The Great Thanksgiving: Eucharistic Prayer A
Presider:
> The Lord be with you.

**People:**
> **And also with you.**

Presider:
> Lift up your hearts.

**People:**
> **We lift them to the Lord.**

Presider:
> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**People:**
> **It is right to give God thanks and praise.**

The Presider continues:
> It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.

##### A Proper Preface may be used here.

> Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:

### Sanctus
**Presider and People:**
> **Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.**

The Presider continues:
> Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.

> He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.

> On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”

> After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”

Presider:
> Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:

**People:**
> **Christ has died.
Christ is risen.
Christ will come again.**

The Presider continues:
> We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.

> Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.

Presider:
> All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.

**People:**
> **AMEN.**

### The Lord's Prayer
Presider:
> And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,

**People:**
> **Therefore let us keep the feast. Alleluia.**

Presider:
> The Gifts of God for the People of God.

## We Receive the Gift of God

**Receiving Communion during Covid:**

Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.

If you wish to receive communion physically:

1. Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)
2. Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.
3. Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.

If you do not wish to receive communion physically:

1. Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.
2. You are invited to utter the _Prayer for Spiritual Communion_ while communion is being distributed.

##### If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)

### The Post-communion Prayer
Presider:
> Let us pray.

**People:**
> **Eternal God, heavenly Father,
you have graciously accepted us as living members
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,
and you have fed us with spiritual food
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.
Send us now into the world in peace,
and grant us strength and courage
to love and serve you
with gladness and singleness of heart;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.**

### The Blessing

### The Dismissal
Deacon:
> Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

_In order to minimize the possibility of infecting others,
please exit the campus immediately._
