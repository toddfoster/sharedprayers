##### The Collect of the Day
Presider:
> Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy, forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid, and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

**People:**
> **Amen.**

## We Hear God’s Word
**The First Lesson**
_Exodus 20:1-4, 7-9, 12-20_

Lector:
> A reading from Exodus.
>
> Then God spoke all these words:
>
> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.
>
> You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
>
> You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.
>
> Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. For six days you shall labour and do all your work.
>
>Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.
>
>You shall not murder.

> You shall not commit adultery.
>
> You shall not steal.
>
> You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
>
> You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
>
> When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance, and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.” Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.”

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**The Psalm** 19
_Caeli enarrant_

> 1	The heavens declare the glory of God, *
and the firmament shows his handiwork.
**2	One day tells its tale to another, *
and one night imparts knowledge to another.**

> 3	Although they have no words or language, *
and their voices are not heard,
**4	Their sound has gone out into all lands, *
and their message to the ends of the world.**

> 5	In the deep has he set a pavilion for the sun; *
it comes forth like a bridegroom out of his chamber;
	it rejoices like a champion to run its course.
**6	It goes forth from the uttermost edge of the heavens
	and runs about to the end of it again; *
nothing is hidden from its burning heat.**

> 7	The law of the Lord is perfect and revives the soul; *
the testimony of the Lord is sure and gives wisdom to the innocent.
**8	The statutes of the Lord are just and rejoice the heart; *
the commandment of the Lord is clear and gives light to the eyes.**

> 9	The fear of the Lord is clean and endures forever; *
the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
**10	More to be desired are they than gold, more than much fine gold, *
sweeter far than honey, than honey in the comb.**

> 11	By them also is your servant enlightened, *
and in keeping them there is great reward.
**12	Who can tell how often he offends? *
cleanse me from my secret faults.**

> 13	Above all, keep your servant from presumptuous sins;
	let them not get dominion over me; *
then shall I be whole and sound, and innocent of a great offense.
**14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
	be acceptable in your sight, *
O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.**



**The Second Lesson**
_Philippians 3:4b-14_

Lector:
> A reading from the letter to the Philippians

> If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
>
> Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
>
> Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

##### The people stand as able.
**The Holy Gospel**
_Matthew 21:33-46_

Deacon:
> The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew.

**People:**
> **Glory to you, Lord Christ.**

Deacon:
> Jesus said, “Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country. When the harvest time had come, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same way. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.” So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.”

Deacon:
> The Gospel of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Praise to you, Lord Christ.**

##### Passing the Peace is primarily a liturgical practice, not a social one. While the threat of Covid-19 is prominent, the peace will be brief. Please do not move around or make contact (shaking hands, hugs) with others. Instead you are invited to look to the person on either side of you and wish them peace with a bow or a wave.

## The Great Thanksgiving: Eucharistic Prayer A
Presider:

**People:**
> **And also with you.**

Presider:
> Lift up your hearts.

**People:**
> **We lift them to the Lord.**

Presider:
> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**People:**
> **It is right to give God thanks and praise.**

The Presider continues:
> It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.

##### A Proper Preface may be used here.

> Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:

### Sanctus
**Presider and People:**
> **Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.**

The Presider continues:
> Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.

> He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.

> On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”

> After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”

Presider:
> Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:

**People:**
> **Christ has died.
Christ is risen.
Christ will come again.**

The Presider continues:
> We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.

> Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.

Presider:
> All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.

**People:**
> **AMEN.**

### The Lord's Prayer

## We Receive the Gift of God

**Receiving Communion during Covid:**

Please remain where you are, standing or seated in prayer. After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, and carefully sanitized hands, the presider will bring the sacrament to each person in turn.

If you wish to receive communion physically:

1. Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread. The presider will drop the host into your hands without making contact. (If you prefer to receive gluten-free bread, please tell the presider so.)
2. Wait until the presider has moved away to remove your mask, consume the host, and replace you mask.
3. Communion will be offered in one kind only (just the bread). This is still full communion.

If you do not wish to receive communion physically:

1. Cross your arms over your chest. The presider will offer you a blessing instead, again without touching.
2. You are invited to utter the _Prayer for Spiritual Communion_ while communion is being distributed.

##### If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefits of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)

### The Post-communion Prayer
Presider:
> Let us pray.

**People:**
> **Eternal God, heavenly Father,
you have graciously accepted us as living members
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,
and you have fed us with spiritual food
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.
Send us now into the world in peace,
and grant us strength and courage
to love and serve you
with gladness and singleness of heart;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.**

### The Blessing

### The Dismissal
Deacon:
> Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

_In order to minimize the possibility of infecting others,
please exit the campus immediately._
