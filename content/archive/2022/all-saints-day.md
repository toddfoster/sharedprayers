Remember Justin, Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael, our Presiding Bishop, William our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.

Remember all your people and those who seek your truth.

Remember N..., all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.
