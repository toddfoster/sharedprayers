##### Passing the Peace is primarily a liturgical practice, not a social one. While the threat of Covid-19 is prominent, the peace will be brief. Please do not move around or make contact (shaking hands, hugs) with others. Instead you are invited to look to the person on either side of you and wish them peace with a bow or a wave.

### Sanctus

> **Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.**

The Presider continues:
> Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.

> He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.

> On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me.”

> After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and said, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.”

Presider:
> Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:

**People:**
> **Christ has died.
Christ is risen.
Christ will come again.**

The Presider continues:
> We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Recalling his death, resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.

> Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new and unending life in him. Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom.

## We Receive the Gift of God

**Receiving Communion during Covid, step by step:**

After the presider has received the Sacrament in both kinds, donned a mask, sanitized hands, and moved in front of the altar the people will receive.
1. When invited by the usher to leave your seat, your whole family unit (domiciled together) may proceed to the sanitizing station. Or you may remain seated and use the prayer for spiritual communion (printed on the next page).
2. Remove or pull down your mask to uncover your mouth.
3. Use hand sanitizer
4. If another party is already receiving communion, wait at the sanitizing station for them to move out of the way.
5. Approach to receive communion. Do not step on the cross which separates you from the presider. Do not kneel. Hold out your cupped hands to receive the bread.
6. The presider will reach out and drop the bread into your hands, avoiding contact. The people will receive communion in one kind only: the bread. This is still full communion.
7. If there is another party waiting at the sanitizing station, stand aside so they can approach to receive communion.
8. Replace your mask, covering your mouth and nose, and return to your seat.

##### If a person desires to receive the Sacrament, but, by reason of extreme sickness or physical disability, is unable to eat and drink the Bread and Wine, the Celebrant is to assure that person that all the benefirts of Communion are received, even though the Sacrament is not received with the mouth. (BCP, 457)

### Prayer for Spiritual Communion
> _My Jesus, I believe that you are truly present
in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.
I love you above all things, and long for you in my soul.
Since I cannot now receive you sacramentally,
come at least spiritually into my heart.
As though you have already come,
I embrace you and unite myself entirely to you;
never permit me to be separated from you. Amen._
>
> _(Attributed to St. Alphonsus de Liguori, 1696-1787)_


### The Post-communion Prayer
Presider:
> Let us pray.

**People:**
> **Eternal God, heavenly Father,
you have graciously accepted us as living members
of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ,
and you have fed us with spiritual food
in the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.
Send us now into the world in peace,
and grant us strength and courage
to love and serve you
with gladness and singleness of heart;
through Christ our Lord. Amen.**

### The Blessing

### The Dismissal
Deacon:
> Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

_In order to minimize the possibility of infecting others,
please exit the campus immediately._
