# Opening Devotions

Introduction (said at the foot of the altar)

##### Leader:
Let us pray the Way of the Cross with a humble and contrite heart, after all it is because of our sins that Jesus had to die for us. Every step of the way to death was made in agony of pain, and every step made in ecstasy of love.

##### **All:**
**Lord Jesus Christ, take me along that holy way you once took to your death. Take my mind, my memory, above all my reluctant heart, and let me see what once you did for love of me and all the world. The Son of God died the criminal's death in love, that we may live in God's mercy, that we may die in His Eternal love. Amen.**

##### As you process between stations say:

##### Leader:
> Lord, have mercy.

##### **People:**
> **Christ, have mercy.**

##### Leader:
> Lord, have mercy.

# Ninth Station


##### Leader:
Jesus, how terrible must have been Your last fall, the whole of Your Body in pain and all Your strength gone. Simon needed all his strength to stop the cross falling on You. Though numbed with exhaustion the fire of Your love for us was unquenched and with utmost giving You made the last painful steps of Your human life.

##### People:
**Jesus, Your love was and is more than all the suffering and sorrow. This is the sign of hope to those who are in despair. Amen.**

# Tenth Station


##### Leader:
Jesus, how great must have been the agony when Your garment was pulled from Your back, raw and bleeding from the scourging. To add to the shame of the Cross You were made naked for us.

##### People:
**Jesus, our souls are naked before God, no adornment can hide our sins. Our only clothing is Your merciful love, our only hope of dignity is in Your sacrifice for us. Amen**

# Eleventh Station


##### Leader:
Jesus, Your hands that blessed and healed and fed the hungry were nailed to the Cross. Your feet that walked so many weary miles to preach the Divine Word, were nailed to the Cross. But You did not need to be nailed, You stretched out Your aching limbs on the hard wood and they were held there by love.

##### People:
**Jesus, help us to feel not bound but only held in love to the cross- es of this life. Amen.**

# Twelfth Station


##### Leader:
Jesus, as the Cross was raised Your poor body sank and every nerve-ending in Your hands and feet were torn by the nails. You were alone in the terrible darkness with only the tear stained face of Your agonized Mother to comfort You. Your disciple standing by was numbed and bewildered. Even their comfort You gave away in love, asking them to care for each other. Your terrible cry “It is finished” completed the sacrifice.

##### People:
**Jesus, how can I recompense such rejection? How can I show enough gratitude for such love? but it is enough that I know, to let you just hold my life in Your love. Amen.**


##### As you process between stations say:

##### Leader:
> Lord, have mercy.

##### **People:**
> **Christ, have mercy.**

##### Leader:
> Lord, have mercy.


----------
 
# Thirteenth Station


##### Leader:
Jesus, as Your sorrowing Mother received Your body from the Cross, the sword of old Simeon’s prophecy pierced the depths of her being. As she tenderly held Your wounded body, did she not remember You as the Babe in her womb, her Infant Child, and her Boy growing up? Mary must have remembered the crowds following You for Your teaching but through her sobbing remembered the crowds that cried “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"

##### People:
**Jesus, may the merits of Your dear Mother’s deep sorrow help us as we pray for all mothers who sorrow for their children, for all who lose dear ones through violence. Amen.**

# Fourteenth Station


##### Leader:
Jesus Your body was laid in the tomb, no longer treated cruelly but handled with reverence and love. Your holy limbs shrouded lay waiting for the new dawn.

##### People:
**Jesus, all Your life here on earth was spent in perfect obedience to Your Father’s will even unto death. Please help me to always be obedient to Your law of love. Strengthen me to face the daily dying to myself. Amen**


##### As you process between stations say:

##### Leader:
> Lord, have mercy.

##### **People:**
> **Christ, have mercy.**

# Fifteenth Station

Jesus, after all Your Passion and agony came Your wonderful Resurrection. You took on our lowly life and gave us Your eternal life. The criminal’s cross is now the sign of our salvation.

##### People:
**Jesus You give us Your Resurrection Joy, You give us Your love and the promise of eternal peace.
Jesus I thank You
Jesus I praise You
Jesus I love You Amen**


##### Leader:
Every step of the way to death was made in agony of pain, and every step made in ecstasy of love. Jesus who is perfect love loves us perfectly.

##### People:
**The Son of God died the criminal's death in love, that we may live in God's mercy, that we may die in His Eternal love. We have walked the way of perfect love.**

##### Leader:
