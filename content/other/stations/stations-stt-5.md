# Before Stations of the Cross

It is appropriate to sit in quiet meditation prior to the beginning of the Stations of the cross. During this time you may:
- Meditate on a passage of scripture
- Pray for Christ’s church and the world
- Confession of Sins


-------


# Opening Devotions

## Introduction (said at the foot of the altar)

##### Leader reads ‘Jesus says’ and either an individual or group reads ‘I say’

### **Jesus says:**
Please come and take a walk with me. A walk of fourteen steps. Let us take this walk together, for even though you are you and I am I, we are ONE – ONE CHRIST.

So the walk I took two thousand years ago, and the walk we will take now, is also one. 

There’s just one difference. My life was not complete until I crowned it by My _death_ and your walk – your fourteen steps will only be completed until you crown it with your _Life._

##### All process to the First Station saying
##### Leader:
Blessed be God.

##### **People:**
**Blessed be His Holy Name.**


-----------------
 
# First Station
## Jesus is condemned to die.
##### The Leader announces the number of each of the stations and its title, then after a short silence begins.

### **Jesus says:**
In Pilate’s hands, I see my Father’s will. Though Pilate is unjust, he is the lawful governor and He has power over Me.

##### Silence.

### **I say:**
My Jesus, Lord, obedience cost You Your life. For me it costs an act of will – no more – and yet how hard it is for me to bend.

Remove the blinders from my eyes that I may see that it is You whom I obey in all who govern me. Lord, it is You!


##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true man.**


-----------------
 
# Second Station
## Jesus carries his cross
------

### **Jesus says:**
This cross, this chunk of tree, is what My Father chose for Me. The crosses you must bear are largely products of your daily life. And yet My Father chose them, too for you. Receive them from His hands. Take heart, I will not let your burdens grow one ounce too heavy for your strength.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Jesus Lord, I take my daily cross. I welcome the monotony that often marks my day, discomforts of all kinds, the summer’s heat, the winter’s cold, my disappointments, tensions, setbacks – cares. Remind me often that in carrying my cross, I carry Yours with You. And thought I bear only a sliver of Your cross, You carry all of mine – in return

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be the Name of Jesus!**

----------
 
# Third Station
## Jesus falls the first time

### **Jesus says:**
The God who made the universe and holds it in existence, by His will alone, becomes a man, too weak to bear a piece of timber’s weight. How human in His weakness is the Son of Man. My Father willed it thus. I could not be your model otherwise. You too must accept life without complaint of your human frailties.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
Lord Jesus how can I refuse? I willingly accept my weaknesses, my irritations and my moods, my headaches and fatigue, all my defects of body, mind and soul. Because they are Your will for me, these “handicaps” of my humanity I gladly suffer them. Make me content with all my discontents but give me strength to struggle after You.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be the Lamb!**

----------

# Fourth Station
## Jesus meets his mother

### **Jesus says:**
My Mother sees me whipped. She sees me kicked and driven like a beast. She counts My every wound, and though her soul cries out in agony, no protest or complaint escapes her lips or even enters her thoughts. She shares My martyrdom – and I share hers. We hide no pain, no sorrow, from each other’s eyes. This is My Father’s will

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Jesus, I know what You are telling me. To watch the pain of those we love is harder than to bear our own. To carry my cross after You, I, Too must stand and watch the sufferings of dear ones, the heartaches, sicknesses and grief of those we love.

And I must let them watch mine too. I do believe, for those who love You, all things work together unto good.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world , have mercy upon us.**

----------
 
# Fifth Station
## Simon helps Jesus carry his cross

### **Jesus says:**
My strength is gone, I can no longer bear the cross alone. And so the legionnaires make Simon give Me aid.

This Simon is like You!

Each time you lift some burden from another’s back, you lift as with your very hand the cross’s awful weight that crushes Me.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
Lord, make me realize that every time I wipe a dish, pick up an object off the floor, assist a child in some small task, or give another preference in traffic or the store, each time I feed the hungry, clothe the naked, teach the ignorant, or lend my hand in any way – it matters not to whom – my name is Simon. And the kindness I extend to them I really give to You.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

##### **People:**
**Christ Have Mercy**

##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

----------
 
# Sixth Station
## Veronica wipes the face of Jesus

### **Jesus says:**
Can you be brave enough to wipe My bloody face? Where is My face you ask? At home whenever eyes fill up with tears, at work when tensions rise, on playgrounds, in the slums, the courts, the hospitals, the jails – wherever suffering exists – My face is there. And there I look for you to wipe away My blood and tears.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
Lord, what You ask is hard. It calls for courage and self-sacrifice, and I am weak. Please, give me strength. Don’t let me run away because of fear.

Lord, live in me, act in me, love in me. And not in me alone – in all men – so that we may reveal no more Your bloody - but Your glorious face on earth.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
##### Leader:
Blessed be God.

##### **People:**
**Blessed be His Holy Name.**


----------
 
# Seventh Station
## Jesus falls the second time

### **Jesus says:** 
This seventh step is one that tests your will. From this fall learn to persevere in doing good.

The time will come when all your efforts seem to fail and you till think “I can’t go on.” Then turn to Me, my heavy laden one, and I will give you rest. Trust me, and carry on.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
Give me Your courage Lord. When failure presses heavily on me and I am desolate, stretch out Your hand and lift me up.

I know I must not cease, but persevere, in doing good.

But help me Lord. Alone, there is nothing I can do, but with You, I can do anything You ask. I will.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true man.**

----------
 
# Eighth Station
## Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem

### **Jesus says:**
How often had I longed to take the children of Jerusalem and gather them to me, but they refused.

But now these women weep for Me and My heart mourns for them – mourns for their sorrow that will come. I comfort those who seek to solace me.

How gentle can you be, how kind?

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Jesus, Your compassion in Your passion is beyond compare. Lord, teach me, help me learn. When I would snap at those who hurt me with their ridicule, those who misunderstand or hinder me with some misguided helpfulness, those who intrude upon my privacy, then help me curb my tongue. May gentleness be my cloak. Lord make me kind like You.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be the Name of Jesus!**

----------
 
# Ninth Station
## Jesus falls the third time

### **Jesus says:**
Completely drained of strength I lie, collapsed, upon the cobblestones. My body cannot move. No blows, no kicks can rouse it up. Any yet My will is Mine, and yours is yours. Know this, your body may be broken, but no force on earth and none in hell can take away your will.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Lord, I see You take a moments rest then rise and stagger on. So I can do, because my will is mine. When all my strength is gone and guilt and selfreproach press me to earth and seem to hold me down, protect me from the sin of Judas – save me from despair.

Lord, never let me feel that any sin of mine is greater than Your love for me. No matter what my past has been, I can begin anew.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Blessed be the Lamb!**

----------
 
# Tenth Station
## Jesus is stripped

### **Jesus says:**
Behold, the poorest King who ever lived. Before my creatures, I stand stripped. The cross – My deathbed – even this is not My own. Yet who has ever been so rich? Possessing nothing – I own all – I own My Father’s love.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Lord, I offer You my all, whatever I possess and more – I offer You my self. Detach me from the craving for prestige, position, wealth. Root out of me all trace of envy, pride and lead me to the lowest place.

May I be poor in spirit Lord, so that I can be rich in You.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
**Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.**

----------
 
# Eleventh Station
## Jesus is nailed to the Cross

### **Jesus says:**
Can you imagine what a crucifixion is? My executioners stretch My arms, they hold My hand and wrist against the wood and press the nail until it stabs My flesh. Then with one heavy hammer smash they drive it through – and pain bursts like a bomb of fire in My brain. They seize the other arm and agony explodes again. Then, raising My knees so that My feet are flat against the wood… they hammer them too.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My God, I look at You and think: Is MY soul worth this much? What can I give You in return? I here and now accept for all my life whatever sickness, torment, agony may come. O blessed cross that lets me be with You.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

##### **People:**
**Christ Have Mercy**

##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

----------
 
# Twelfth Station
## Jesus dies on the Cross

### **Jesus says:**
The cross becomes a pulpit now --- “Forgive them Father…. You will be with Me in Paradise… There is your mother… There … your son… I thirst…. It is complete.” To speak I have to raise Myself by pressing on My wrists and feet, and every move engulfs Me in new waves of agony. And then when I have borne enough, have emptied My humanity, I let My mortal life depart.

##### Kneel if able

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Jesus, what can I say or do? I offer You my death, with all it’s pains, accepting now the time and kind of death in store for me. I offer You my death for my own sins and those of all my fellowmen. My God, my God! Forsake us not for we know not what we do.

##### Silence

##### All stand

##### All process to the next station in silence.


----------
 
# Thirteenth Station
## Jesus is taken down from the cross

### **Jesus says:**
The sacrifice is done. Yes, My Mass is complete, but not My mother’s and not yours. My mother still must cradle in her arms the lifeless body of the Son she bore. You too, must part from those you love, and grief will come to you. In your bereavements think of this: A multitude of souls were saved by Mary’s sharing in My Calvary. Your grief can also be the price of souls.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
I beg You Lord, help me accept the partings that must come – from friends who go away, my children leaving home and most of all, my dear ones when You shall call them to Yourself. Then, give me grace to say “As it has pleased You Lord, to take them home I bow to Your most holy will and if by just one word I might restore their lives against their will I would not speak.” Grant them eternal joy.

##### All process to the next station saying: 
##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

##### **People:**
**Christ Have Mercy**

##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy



----------
 
# Fourteenth Station
## Jesus is laid in the tomb

### **Jesus says:**
So ends my mortal life. But now another life begins for Mary, for Magdalene, for Peter, for John.. And for you. My work as man is done. My work within and through the church must now commence. Day in and day out from this time forth, be My apostle – my victim – be my saint.

##### Silence

### **I say:**
My Jesus, You know my spirit is willing, but my flesh is weak. The teaching You could not impart, the sufferings You could not bear, the works of love You could not do in Your short life of earth, let me impart and bear and do through You. But I am nothing without You Lord. Help me!

##### All process to the foot of the altar saying: 
##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy

##### **People:**
**Christ Have Mercy**

##### Leader:
Lord Have Mercy




----------
# Conclusion 
## Concluding Prayers before the Altar

### **Jesus says:**
I told you at the start, My life was not complete until I crowned it by My death. Your “way” is not complete unless you crown it by your life.

Accept each moment as it comes to you with faith and trust that all that happens has My mark on it. A simple fiat that is all it takes, a breathing in your heart, “I will it Lord.”

So seek Me not in far-off place. I am close at hand. Your workbench, office, kitchen, these are altars where you offer love. And I am with you there. Go now!

Take up your cross and with your life – complete your way!

##### Silence

##### Say together the Lord’s Prayer


------
# There is a green hill far away

There is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

_(Refrain)_
O dearly, dearly, has He loved,
And we must love Him, too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.

We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there. _(Refrain)_

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood. _(Refrain)_

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven and let us in. _(Refrain)_

O dearly, dearly has He loved,
And we must love Him, too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do. _(Refrain)_

# Why do the Stations of the Cross?

The most important reason for reviving the practice of making the Stations of the Cross is that it is a powerful way to contemplate, and enter into, the mystery of Jesus' gift of himself to us. It takes the reflection on the passion out of my head, and makes it an imaginative exercise. It involves my senses, my experience and my emotions. To the extent I come to experience the love of Jesus _for me,_ to that extent the gratitude I feel will be deep. Deep gratitude leads to real generosity and a desire to love as I have been loved. First, just a note about the history of the stations:

The History:

From the earliest of days, followers of Jesus told the story of his passion, death and resurrection. When pilgrims came to see Jerusalem, they were anxious to see the sites where Jesus was. These sites become important holy connections with Jesus. Eventually, following in the footsteps of the Lord, along the way of the cross, became a part of the pilgrimage visit. The stations, as we know them today, came about when it was no longer easy or even possible to visit the holy sites. In the 1500's, villages all over Europe started creating "replicas" of the way of the cross, with small shrines commemorating the places along the route in Jerusalem. Eventually, these shrines became the set of 14 stations we now know and were placed in almost every Catholic Church in the world.

The most important thing to remember is that this can be as personal as I'd like it to be. One of our common religious struggles is to realize that we are not alone. The Good News is that Jesus entered into our life's experience completely - even suffering and death - and that he fell into the hands of a Loving God, who raised him from death to life. We can have complete hope that suffering and death have no complete hold on us. We will all share eternal life with him, if we can fall into the hands of the same Loving God. And, along the way, we are not alone. Jesus is with as one who knows our suffering, and the death we face. That can be deeply consoling.
