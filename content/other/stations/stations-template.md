Introduction (said at the foot of the altar)

As Christians we are invited to pickup our cross every day and follow after Jesus. Initially this is not a pleasant thought. Not a pleasant thought because when we think about the cross, we think of the cross Jesus had to carry to Calvary. We know that such a cross, weighed down with the sins of the world, would be impossible for us to carry. Jesus, however, does not ask us to pick up His cross ... but our cross ... a cross that may be challenging but a cross that would not be as heavy as Christ’s cross.

The cross always involves suffering but a suffering can be a redemptive, spiritual suffering. The cross tells us that by Christ’s stripes ... by Christ’s suffering ... we are healed. Our suffering, however, can also be redemptive. Suffering can help us put life in perspective. Suffering can help us realize that we do not have a lasting city for ourselves in this world. Suffering can soften our hold on this world ... can help us to let go so that we can move into eternity. Suffering can help make us compassionate and merciful as God is compassionate and merciful. Suffering can help make us aware of our vulnerability.

The Stations of the Cross, as a devotion, can help us visualize part of what Jesus suffered to redeem us. The Stations of the Cross can serve as a model for us as to how we should react to the Way of the Cross.

**As you process between stations say:**

##### Leader:

##### Leader:
