-------

## WE BEGIN

In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. **Amen.**

> _Then Jesus said to them ‘If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow me.’_ LK 9:23


---------------
 
# First Station
## Jesus is condemned to death

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_And the crowd called out ‘Crucify him. Crucify him.’_ LK 23:21

Poverty, religious persecution and oppressive political regimes condemn our brothers and sisters to migration. In their homeland they do not have religious freedom or the opportunity to achieve personal, familial and social goals. Violence, as well as economic and political discrimination, forces people to abandon their homeland. In his humanity, Jesus lived the suffering and instability of the migrant. As people of faith, we must find concrete ways of transforming unjust realities so that no one feels compelled to migrate.

Lord Jesus, you knew the bitterness of immigration, give us a sense of solidarity to welcome migrants who walk in search for a better future.

# Second Station
## Jesus accepts his cross

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_They took him, and he went out carrying the Cross himself, to a place called The Skull, in Hebrew,
Golgotha._ JN 19:1

The migrant leaves out of necessity. For some, the exodus is from the countryside to the city for others, it is a journey to other nations simply to put food on the table. Most of the time, the migrant is not welcome in a new land, much like Jesus was not welcomed by many. The lack of equitable distribution of land assets drives thousands to despair. Internal and foreign migration results in the migrant being forced to carry the cross of abuse, loneliness and discrimination. Racism, xenophobia, exploitation and restrictive immigration policies face them wherever they go.

Jesus, with our migrant brothers, we carry this cross with love, remembering that one day we will be with you in paradise.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

----------
 
# Third Station
## Jesus falls the first time

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_He was despised and rejected by humankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one
from whom people hide their faces, he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took
up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and
afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the
punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed._ ISA 53: 3-5

The migrant is despised and humiliated. There is nothing crueler than being betrayed by
people you trusted. Migrants are betrayed and violated of their fundamentals rights often by their own countrymen and friends- which results in countless cases of human
rights violations. They are subject to arrest and imprisonment, and are usually not paid a
fair wage.

Oh God! May we also help our brothers and sisters up from their fall, showing trust,
understanding and solidarity.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

----------

# Fourth Station
## Jesus meets his mother

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother: ‘Behold this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed and a sword will pierce our own soul, too.’ _LK 2:34-35

Poverty has a specific face in women. They are domestic workers and nannies. Many women seek work in the big cities or abroad, forcing them to separate from husbands, children, and relatives for long periods of time. To look into the eyes of these women, is to remember the look of sadness of Mary when she sees her Son, Jesus, suffer.

Thank God for Mary, who was with Jesus in both good times and bad. Lord God, intercede for the migrant woman who suffers daily from loneliness and separation. Open our hearts to understand and love these women and mothers.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


 
# Fifth Station
## Simon helps Jesus carry his cross

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_Outside they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and forced him to carry the Cross._ MT 27:32

Jesus is present in every migrant who is forced to carry the cross of unjust immigration laws and labeled a criminal for simply seeking a better future. On the migrant road, there are many false friends who betray and take advantage of migrants leading them to crime, prostitution, and exploited labor. We all need to help migrants just as Simon helped Jesus. Often people are willing to help by forming shelters, soup kitchens, and places where migrants can find work. Let us open our hearts to our fellow migrants.

Lord Jesus Christ, allow that in the bottom of our hearts we can be a loving presence to our weaker brethren. May your spirit help us to sacrifice our time to meet the needs of migrants with love.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------

 
# Sixth Station
## Veronica wipes the face of Jesus

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_And I, for my innocence, I'll see your face, waking my joy in your presence._ PS 16:15

Humiliation accompanies the migrant. Every Christian should imitate Veronica by transforming their life into images of Christ. We must oppose restrictive immigration laws that diminish human dignity. Because of laws that favor the powerful, many of our brothers and sisters suffer. Many migrants are condemned like Jesus to die a slow death in deserts and border crossings. Laws should respect human dignity and adhere to international treaties.

We extend our prayers to Almighty God for all rulers and authorities that, like Veronica, they will be compassionate to the migrant and pass laws favorable to human rights, migrants, and their families.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------

 
# Seventh Station
## Jesus falls the second time

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_All we, like sheep, had all gone astray, we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all._ ISA 53:6

The Lord bears on his shoulders, the suffering of those who have been forced to leave their homeland because of violence or for political or religious persecution. The Holy Family was forced to immigrate because of political persecution. Globalization has opened borders to new markets while it also prevents the free movement of persons. Let us fight for a world without borders for all who are persecuted.

We ask Lord, that you who knew the bitterness of forced migration, move us to solidarity with those who search for a better future.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


 
# Eighth Station
## Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_And there followed him a great multitude of people and of women who bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them said, ‘Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.’_ LK 23:27-28

"Mother, for all you have done for me I give thanks. I leave now and would rather not look back because I need to forge a new path. Let me depart without seeing you suffer. I'm going, but you are always with me, as I know I am in you." These are the difficult, sincere words that children speak to their mothers before they leave home. Wives also hear these parting words which tears their hearts to shreds.

Lord we ask you for intercession of your mother. Enlighten the path and the hearts of the children and parents who are forced to leave out of necessity. Give them strength to overcome the difficulties that are present in other lands.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


 
# Ninth Station
## Jesus falls the third time

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_Come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest._ MT 11:28

The face of migrants reflects the harsh reality that is their life. There is nostalgia for the things they left behind; their identity, their culture, their customs, their neighbors. Jesus gives a sublime testimony and invites us to experience the love of those who suffer. True solidarity is a means of recognizing, understanding and friendship.

God of life, we ask that you protect your sons and daughters who are migrants on a way full of risks and hazards. help them overcome obstacles to find a decent job, to get up again, and move on.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


 
# Tenth Station
## Jesus is stripped of his garments

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_After they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. And sitting down, they kept watch over him there._ MT 27:35-36

The bodies of many migrant men, women and children, are objects to be sold and trafficked by smugglers who operate with impunity in the transit countries of migrants. Many suffer physical and sexual abuse and are forced into prostitution. They are stripped of their rights, their belongings, and even their lives. Like Jesus, these boys and girls are battered reflections of our evil world.

Jesus, deliver us from immorality. Clean our anxious hearts from earthly pleasures. Stop the desire for profit and goods made at any price and give us a compassionate heart like yours.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


 
# Eleventh Station
## Jesus is nailed to the Cross

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_When they came to the place that is called the Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left._ LK 23:33

We see how, that in many places the migrant, like Jesus, is crucified by discrimination, injustice, exploitation and humiliation. Each, as sons and daughters of God, are entitled to respect.

Lord Jesus, many migrants have been robbed on the road. Through your Holy Spirit guide our leaders to govern fairly, fighting always for the welfare of weaker people.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------

 
# Twelfth Station
## Jesus dies on the Cross

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_When it was about the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in half. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice said 'Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.’ And having said this he breathed his last breath._ LK 23:44-46

Jesus dies due to the indifference and disregard of others. He dies screaming his grief and abandonment. Many migrants die each day along borders from bullets or from dehydration. Other migrants die in prison or on the streets without jobs, healthcare or rights.

Lord, you who knew the bitterness of immigration, give us a sense of solidarity to welcome families and not violate the dignity of any human being with an attitude of selfishness or indifference.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------

 
# Thirteenth Station
## Jesus is taken down from the cross

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take the Body of Jesus: and Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the Body of Jesus._ JN 19:38

There are many individuals who have put aside their selfishness and personal interests to form communities that host migrants forced to move around the world. Jesus said "I was a stranger and you welcomed me." MT 25:35 In welcoming the migrant, we welcome Jesus.

God of life, give us compassion and help us to serve our migrant brothers and sisters.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------


# Fourteenth Station
## Jesus is laid in the tomb

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_Joseph took the Body, wrapped it in clean linen and laid him in his new tomb which he had hewn in
the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away._ MT 27: 59-60

God's Son is buried. He has gone beyond all suffering, all humiliation, all understanding. The migrant is also alone, suffering and has given their life for the extreme love of family and children. Because of this love, many migrants also end up in either a tomb, prison or detention center where they are separated even further from their families and friends.

Lord, do not let anyone or anything separate us from you. Lord, help us to stand strong in our faith and not hesitate or falter in our loyalty and trust in your love. Remind us that your love will not fail us so that our spirit will always remain firm in your holy service. Amen

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

---------------------------

# Fifteenth Station
## The Resurrection

> **We adore you, O Christ, and we praise you.
> Because by your Holy Cross, you have redeemed the world.**

_He is risen._ MT 28:6

Some migrants - through the mercy and compassion of others - are fortunate to begin a new life, in a new land, in a new home. They, too, have been resurrected through pain and suffering.

Lord, God. We pray that those who have experienced rebirth through immigration will now serve others who want to migrate as well. Give them a grateful heart that they might assist others in their transition to new life.

**Our Father . . . Hail Mary . . . Glory be to the Father . . .**

May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. **Amen**

# The Stations of the Cross
The Stations of the Cross, the Way of the Cross, the Way of Sorrows, or the Via Crucis, all refer to the journey Jesus Christ travelled from the time he was condemned to death until his Body was placed in a burial tomb. Followers of Jesus have told the story of his Passion, Death and Resurrection while pilgrims who travelled to Jerusalem visited the sites where it is believed that Jesus was tried and executed. Journals have been discovered, dated as early as the fourth century, describing these pilgrims chanting psalms as they processed the Via Dolorosa (the Way of Sorrows) in Jerusalem. Liturgists view these processions as an embryonic form of the Stations of the Cross.

Many churches typically contain fourteen Stations but as an outgrowth of the Second Vatican Council, a fifteenth Station was added reflecting our Lord’s victory over suffering and death and the Good News of Easter – the Resurrection. As we are a post Vatican Council II church, all of our Stations of the Cross, both inside the church and outside, reflect this more complete narrative. Today, Christians everywhere follow Jesus’ final journey to unite their suffering with his in the hope of sharing in his Resurrection. In the words of St. Paul: "_I wish to know Christ and to be conformed into the pattern of his death, so that somehow I may come to know the power of his Resurrection._" Phil 3:1

## Disposition for praying the Stations of the Cross
Suffering – in one of its many forms - invades all of our lives; no one needs to search for it. We may attempt to deny or run from suffering but it cannot be avoided. What is demanded is the need to come to terms with suffering. It is in this context that we provide the Stations of the Cross for Various Circumstances. We invite you to pray these Stations as a means of uniting your personal trials with our Lord’s, so that you too might share in his Passion so as to rejoice in his Resurrection.

We believe in a God who became incarnate through his Son, Jesus Christ, who chose to suffer for the sake of our redemption. This Passion is made visible in the physical Way of the Cross and metaphysically in the psychological, emotional and spiritual suffering that took place in the Garden of Gethsemane – which one might call the overture to the Via Crucis.

The radical symbol of the Cross - ubiquitous throughout the world - has lost much of its shocking, paradoxical impact. We see the Cross hanging on walls, towering above churches and suspended from one another’s necks in precious gold. The Cross has become a thing of beauty - and it should - for without the sacrifice made on the Cross, there would be no hope of eternal happiness with God.

When we pray the Stations, it is not for the purpose of undertaking an historical remembering of what occurred, but to show us what is happening now - what is happening within each of us. The reason for praying the Stations of the Cross is to enter into the mystery of Jesus' gift of himself for us – to experience his means of transforming suffering through love. We do this “through, with, and in him”, step by step, learning how this plan of love can be carried out by us today. In one form or another, his trials are revealed in ours and our trials in his. This frames the spiritual pilgrimage which you are invited to undertake through your particular circumstances, in contemplation of the Passion of Jesus Christ inspired by our faith in the Resurrection.

## Allow One Hour
“_Could you not watch and pray with me for one hour?_” MT 26:40

For the Cross of our Lord’s Passion becomes our Tree of Eternal Life

# About Daylesford Abbey's Stations of the Cross
## The Arbor Gateway
Thresholds are primarily spiritual in nature, not simply physical. Thus, crossing a threshold confirms one’s willingness to move from the natural world to the supernatural. Our gateway entrance marks passage through a holy doorway designed to symbolize one’s decision to enter into the life of Jesus.

## Saint Raphael
Raphael, which translates as "It is God who heals", is the archangel known for facilitating all manners of healing. He is one of only three of the seven archangels named in the Bible. Raphael is credited with driving an evil spirit from Sarah and restoring Tobit's vision through the use of a fish. Tobit 6:7 Raphael is the patron saint of pilgrims and the appropriate guide for all who travel the Stations - particularly those seeking physical, emotional or spiritual healing. Pilgrimages in early times were a dangerous consideration. Pilgrims made wills before their journey as there was no certainty of a safe return. Unlike tourists, pilgrims travel toward their center; while tourists travel away. As a guardian to pilgrims, Raphael is often depicted holding a staff as well as a fish. The mission of Daylesford Abbey is healing and reconciliation, thus providing a suitable home for St. Raphael.

## The Trail
Most Stations of the Cross are typically laid out so that one follows a trail where station posts are staked and one pauses to pray. The Abbey's Stations are designed with alcoves where one must physically exit the trail - a place of certainty - so as to enter the spirituality of each Station’s mystery. Physically, one interrupts their journey to undergo an experience of potentially unitive and transformative change.

## The Station Frame
Wood is a powerful, consistent symbol throughout Scripture: the tree in the Garden of Eden, Noah’s ark, the altar in Exodus, the kindling Isaac carries. It is not by happenstance that both Jesus and Joseph were carpenters. For Christians, all wood signifies and leads us to the one salvific wood of the Cross. Jesus’ sacrifice, which redeemed us on Calvary, is re-membered today in the Eucharistic sacrifice that takes place on the altar. All grace flows from the Cross, from our Abbey’s altar, which is why our Station’s frames are designed to replicate the Abbey church. They are crafted from Brazilian hardwood of substantial weight and density but are ecologically respectful of the Amazon forest, reminding us of God's original commission to humankind in Eden - to be stewards of creation.

## The Station Images
The Station scenes are bas-relief replicas from the bronze doors located at the Basilica of San Zeno in Verona, Italy. According to tradition, the crypt inside the Basilica was the marriage site of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. The church is Romanesque in design typical of 12th century architecture. Our holy father, St. Norbert, lived during that time and the established the Order of Prémontré in 1120, thus connecting the Stations to the founding of our Order.

## The Tree Trunk Benches
Daylesford Abbey took root and evolved from our original home at the site of the former Cassatt Estate. As Providence would arrange it, an oak tree was being removed from that property while our Stations were under construction. Our plans called for some seating to be formed from large tree trunks. This coincidence provided the symbolic means to represent our historical roots.
