we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name. Amen.**

and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.**

**and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, ***
**and the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it, *
and his hands have molded the dry land.**

---

> **Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, ***
**and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is our God,
and we are the people of his pasture

**Psalm 75**
_Confitebimur tibi_

> 1	We give you thanks, O God, we give you thanks, \*
calling upon your Name and declaring all your wonderful deeds.
> **2	"I will appoint a time," says God; \*
"I will judge with equity.**

> 3	Though the earth and all its inhabitants are quaking, \*
I will make its pillars fast.
> **4	I will say to the boasters, 'Boast no more,' \*
and to the wicked, 'Do not toss your horns;**

> 5	Do not toss your horns so high, \*
nor speak with a proud neck.'"
> **6	For judgment is neither from the east
nor from the west, \*
nor yet from the wilderness or the mountains.**

---
> 7	It is God who judges; \*
he puts down one and lifts up another.
> **8	For in the LORD's hand there is a cup,
full of spiced and foaming wine,
which he pours out, \*
and all the wicked of the earth
shall drink and drain the dregs.**

> 9	But I will rejoice for ever; \*
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
> **10	He shall break off all the horns of the wicked; \*
but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.**

---
**Psalm 76**
_Notus in Judœa_

> 1	In Judah is God known; \*
his Name is great in Israel.
> **2	At Salem is his tabernacle, \*
and his dwelling is in Zion.**

> 3	There he broke the flashing arrows, \*
the shield, the sword, and the weapons of battle.
> **4	How glorious you are! \*
more splendid than the everlasting mountains!**

> 5	The strong of heart have been despoiled;
they sink into sleep; \*
none of the warriors can lift a hand.
> **6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, \*
both horse and rider lie stunned.**

---
> 7	What terror you inspire! \*
who can stand before you when you are angry?
> **8	From heaven you pronounced judgment; \*
the earth was afraid and was still;**

> 9	When God rose up to judgment \*
and to save all the oppressed of the earth.
> **10	Truly, wrathful Edom will give you thanks, \*
and the remnant of Hamath will keep your feasts.**

> 11	Make a vow to the LORD your God and keep it; \*
let all around him bring gifts
to him who is worthy to be feared.
> **12	He breaks the spirit of princes, \*
and strikes terror in the kings of the earth.**

> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit: *
> as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be for ever. Amen.**
