## We Hear God’s Word
**The First Lesson** --- _Exodus 12:1-14 NRSV_

Lector:
> A reading from the book of Exodus.
>> The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month shall mark for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth of this month they are to take a lamb for each family, a lamb for each household. If a household is too small for a whole lamb, it shall join its closest neighbour in obtaining one; the lamb shall be divided in proportion to the number of people who eat of it. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of Israel shall slaughter it at twilight. They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it. They shall eat the lamb that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted over the fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. You shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn. This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the passover of the Lord. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human beings and animals; on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgements: I am the Lord. The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live: when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
>>
>> This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**Psalm 116:1,10-17** -- _Dilexi, quoniam_ --- _(BCP 759)_
> 1  I love the Lord, because he has heard the voice of my supplication, *
because he has inclined his ear to me whenever I called upon him.

> **10 How shall I repay the Lord *
for all the good things he has done for me?**

> 11 I will lift up the cup of salvation *
and call upon the Name of the Lord.

> **12 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord *
in the presence of all his people.**

> 13 Precious in the sight of the Lord *
is the death of his servants.

> **14 O Lord, I am your servant; *
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid; you have freed me from my bonds.**

> 15 I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving *
and call upon the Name of the Lord.

> **16 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord *
in the presence of all his people,**

> 17 In the courts of the Lord’s house, *
in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.

> **Hallelujah!**

**The Second Lesson** --- _1 Corinthians 11:23-26 NRSV_
Lector:
> A reading from Paul’s first letter to the church at Corinth.

>> For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ‘This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.’ For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**The Third Lesson** --- _John 13:1-17, 31b-35 NRSV_
Lector:
> A reading from John’s Gospel.

>> Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. The devil had already put it into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot to betray him. And during supper Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, got up from the table, took off his outer robe, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, ‘Lord, are you going to wash my feet?’ Jesus answered, ‘You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.’ Peter said to him, ‘You will never wash my feet.’ Jesus answered, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.’ Simon Peter said to him, ‘Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!’ Jesus said to him, ‘One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.’ For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, ‘Not all of you are clean.’
>>
>>  After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their master, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
>>
>> When he had gone out, Jesus said, ‘Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once. Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, “Where I am going, you cannot come.” I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.’

Lector:
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

##### You may access a homily online at the church website. Or you may want to use the following meditation.

-------------------

**Meditation:**
_This word about the love of Jesus is always the beginning of any time.  By remembering the Passover and the Last Supper and the footwashing, we are not trying to get back to an old time.  In the face of the suffering and death with which the world is filled, our trying would not come to much.  But God’s word comes to us now.  To our time.  Even when we cannot meet for the holy supper together, this word — which takes these three nights to say — comes to us: Jesus Christ is our forgiveness.  He is the Lamb whose blood marks the doors of our houses and bodies.  In the power of the Spirit, he has washed our feet and our lives.  And he turns us toward our neighbors.  In this word — and in the cross proclaimed tomorrow and the resurrection proclaimed on Saturday night — Easter comes out to hold us already._

-------------------


## We Respond in Faith
##### This is the time when we wash feet, recalling Jesus washing his disciples’ feet. The washing of his disciples’ feet was a demonstration of Christ’s love for us, and was followed immediately with a “new commandment”: that we love one another as he loved them. As we work together to suppress the death toll of the Covid-19 virus, washing our hands is an expression of love for our neighbor. Here you may wash your hands, using the water in the bowl.
