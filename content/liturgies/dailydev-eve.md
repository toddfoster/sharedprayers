##### This devotion may be used before or after the evening meal.

##### The Order of Worship for the Evening, page 109, may be used instead.

> O gracious light,
> pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,
> O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!
>
> Now as we come to the setting of the sun,
> and our eyes behold the vesper light,
> we sing your praises, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
>
> You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,
> O Son of God, O Giver of Life,
> and to be glorified through all the worlds.

## A Reading
> It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus’ sake. For the same God who said, “Out of darkness let light shine,” has caused his light to shine within us, to give the light of revelation--the revelation of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. (_2 Corinthians 4:5-6_)

##### Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.

## The Lord’s Prayer
> Our Father in heaven,
> hallowed be your Name,
> your kingdom come,
> your will be done,
> on earth as in heaven.
> Give us today our daily bread.
> Forgive us our sins
> as we forgive those
> 	who sin against us.
> Save us from the time of trial,
> and deliver us from evil.
> For the kingdom, the power,
> and the glory are yours,
> now and for ever.  Amen

## The Collect
> Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake of your love. Amen.
