## Preparing for the Liturgy

_Sit before an unlit candle and a bowl of water._

-------------

## We Gather in God’s Name

Officiant:
> Dear friends in Christ: On this most holy night, in which our Lord Jesus passed over from death to life, the Church invites her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in vigil and prayer. For this is the Passover of the Lord, in which, by hearing his Word and celebrating his Sacraments, we share in his victory over death.

##### The candle is lit.

Officiant:
> The light of Christ, rising in glory, dispel the darkness of our  hearts and minds.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

##### The Officiant reads the Exsultet, an “Easter Proclamation.”
### The Exsultet
> Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels,
and let your trumpets shout Salvation
for the victory of our mighty King.
Rejoice and sing now, all the round earth,
bright with a glorious splendor,
for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King.
Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church,
and let your holy courts, in radiant light,
resound with the praises of your people.
>
> It is truly right and good, always and everywhere,
with our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you,
the invisible, almighty, and eternal God,
and your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord;
for he is the true Paschal Lamb,
who at the feast of the Passover paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin,
and by his blood delivered your faithful people.
>
> This is the night,
when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt,
and led them through the Red Sea on dry land.
>
> This is the night,
when all who believe in Christ are delivered from the gloom of sin,
and are restored to grace and holiness of life.
>
> This is the night,
when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.
>
> Holy Father, accept our evening sacrifice,
the offering of this candle in your honor.
May it shine continually to drive away all darkness.
May Christ, the Morning Star who knows no setting,
find it ever burning––he who gives his light to all creation,
and who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.

## The Liturgy of the Word
Officiant:
> This is the time each year where we tell our family story. These are tales told around a campfire, stories told by candlelight. It is the story of God’s saving work in ages past, the story that continues in our own lives today as God brings each of us to the fullness of redemption.
