Shared Prayers was inspired by an encounter at Forma 2020 where a congregation that regularly meets outdoors hosted Morning Prayers. They handed out pages, but I thought it made sense to let people pray from their phones. My favorite part is that every liturgy as a QR code at top, so anyone who is already loaded the prayers can share with others, e.g., with those who arrive after the service has started. When using Shared Prayers, everyone's an usher!
