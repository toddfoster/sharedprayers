**Psalm** 91
_Qui habitat_

> 1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, \*
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.
> **2	He shall say to the LORD,
"You are my refuge and my stronghold, \*
my God in whom I put my trust."**

> 3	He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter \*
and from the deadly pestilence.
> **4	He shall cover you with his pinions,
and you shall find refuge under his wings; \*
his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.**

---
> 5	You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, \*
nor of the arrow that flies by day;
> **6	Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, \*
nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.**

> 7	A thousand shall fall at your side
and ten thousand at your right hand, \*
but it shall not come near you.
> **8	Your eyes have only to behold \*
to see the reward of the wicked.**

---
> 9	Because you have made the LORD your refuge, \*
and the Most High your habitation,
> **10	There shall no evil happen to you, \*
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.**

> 11	For he shall give his angels charge over you, \*
to keep you in all your ways.
> **12	They shall bear you in their hands, \*
lest you dash your foot against a stone.**

---
> 13	You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; \*
you shall trample the young lion and the serpent under your feet.
> **14	Because he is bound to me in love,
therefore will I deliver him; \*
I will protect him, because he knows my Name.**

> 15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; \*
I am with him in trouble;
I will rescue him and bring him to honor.
> **16	With long life will I satisfy him, \*
and show him my salvation.**

> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit: \*
> as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be for ever. Amen.**
