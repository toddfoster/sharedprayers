to the glory of your Name. Amen.**

**Psalm 107:1-3, 17-22**
_Confitemini Domino_

1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, \*  
and his mercy endures for ever.  
**2 Let all those whom the Lord has redeemed proclaim \*  
that he redeemed them from the hand of the foe.**

3 He gathered them out of the lands; \*  
from the east and from the west,  
	from the north and from the south.  
**17 Some were fools and took to rebellious ways; \*  
they were afflicted because of their sins.**

---
18 They abhorred all manner of food \*  
and drew near to death's door.  
**19 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, \*  
and he delivered them from their distress.**

20 He sent forth his word and healed them \*  
and saved them from the grave.  
**21 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his mercy \*  
and the wonders he does for his children.**

22 Let them offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving \*  
and tell of his acts with shouts of joy.

> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

and born of the Virgin Mary.  
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died, and was buried.

He ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.**

Give us this day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  
And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil.  
For thine is the kingdom,  
and the power,  
and the glory,  
for ever and ever. Amen.**
