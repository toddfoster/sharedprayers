_Officiant_ and **People**
> **Almighty God, our heavenly Father:  
We have sinned against you,  
through our own fault,  
in thought, and word, and deed,  
and in what we have left undone.  
For the sake of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,  
forgive us all our offenses;  
and grant that we may serve you  
in newness of life,  
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.**

*Officiant*
> May the Almighty God grant us forgiveness of all our sins, and the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit.

**Psalm** 4
_Cum invocarem_

> 1	Answer me when I call, O God,  
defender of my cause; \*  
you set me free when I am hard-pressed;  
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.  
> **2	"You mortals,  
	how long will you dishonor my glory; \*  
how long will you worship dumb idols  
and run after false gods?"**  
  
> 3	Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; \*  
when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.  
> **4	Tremble, then, and do not sin; \*  
speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.**  
  
---
  
> 5	Offer the appointed sacrifices \*  
and put your trust in the LORD.  
> **6	Many are saying,  
"Oh, that we might see better times!" \*  
Lift up the light of your countenance upon us,  
O LORD.**  
  
> 7	You have put gladness in my heart, \*  
more than when grain and wine and oil increase.  
> **8	I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; \*  
for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.**  

> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit: \*  
> as it was in the beginning, is now,  
and will be for ever. Amen.**

on earth as in heaven.

Forgive us our sins  
as we forgive those  
who sin against us.  
Save us from the time of trial,  
and deliver us from evil.**
