## From Psalm 51

> Open my lips, O Lord, *
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, *
and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from your presence *
and take not your holy Spirit from me.
Give me the joy of your saving help again *
and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

## A Reading
> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. _(I Peter 1:3)_

##### A period of silence may follow.

##### A hymn or canticle may be used; the Apostles’ Creed may be said.

##### Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.

## The Lord’s Prayer
> Our Father in heaven,
> hallowed be your Name,
> your kingdom come,
> your will be done,
> on earth as in heaven.
> Give us today our daily bread.
> Forgive us our sins
> as we forgive those
> 	who sin against us.
> Save us from the time of trial,
> and deliver us from evil.
> For the kingdom, the power,
> and the glory are yours,
> now and for ever.  **Amen.**

## The Collect
> Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
