## From Psalm 113

> Give praise, you servants of the Lord; *
praise the Name of the Lord.
Let the Name of the Lord be blessed, *
from this time forth for evermore.
From the rising of the sun to its going down *
let the Name of the Lord be praised.
The Lord is high above all nations, *
and his glory above the heavens.

## A Reading
O God, you will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are fixed on you; for in returning and rest we shall be saved; in quietness and trust shall be our strength. _(Isaiah 26:3; 30:15)_
