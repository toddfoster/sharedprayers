_Lucerna pedibus meis_

105  Your word is a lantern to my feet *
 and a light upon my path.
**106  I have sworn and am determined *
 to keep your righteous judgments.**

107  I am deeply troubled; *
 preserve my life, O Lord, according to your word.
**108  Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute of my lips, *
 and teach me your judgments.**

109  My life is always in my hand, *
 yet I do not forget your law.
**110  The wicked have set a trap for me, *
 but I have not strayed from your commandments.**

111  Your decrees are my inheritance for ever; *
 truly, they are the joy of my heart.
**112  I have applied my heart to fulfill your statues *
 for ever and to the end.**
