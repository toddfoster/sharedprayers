forgive us all our offenses;
and grant that we may serve you
in newness of life,
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.**

_A lesson is read_
> Come to me, all who labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. _Matthew 11:28-30_

**People**
> **Thanks be to God.**
