## Psalm 134
> Behold now, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, *
you that stand by night in the house of the Lord.
Lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the Lord; *
the Lord who made heaven and earth bless you out of Zion.

## A Reading
Lord, you are in the midst of us and we are called by your Name: Do not forsake us, O Lord our God. _(Jeremiah 14:9, 22)_

##### The following may be said
> Lord, you now have set your servant free *
to go in peace as you have promised;
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:
A Light to enlighten the nations, *
and the glory of your people Israel.

##### Prayers for ourselves and others may follow. It is appropriate that prayers of thanksgiving for the blessings of the day, and penitence for our sins, be included.

## The Lordâ€™s Prayer
> Our Father in heaven,
> hallowed be your Name,
> your kingdom come,
> your will be done,
> on earth as in heaven.
> Give us today our daily bread.
> Forgive us our sins
> as we forgive those
> 	who sin against us.
> Save us from the time of trial,
> and deliver us from evil.
> For the kingdom, the power,
> and the glory are yours,
> now and for ever.  **Amen.**

## The Collect
> Visit this place, O Lord, and drive far from it all snares of the enemy; let your holy angels dwell with us to preserve us in peace; and let your blessing be upon us always; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

> The almighty and merciful Lord, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, bless us and keep us. **Amen.**
