date: 2021-02-21

season: lent
weekday: sunday
---

This liturgy leaves spaces for the Psalm and up to three lessons. A reader might hold these passages ready to share at the appropriate places in the liturgy.

Lessons for the daily office can be found in the Book of Common Prayer on pp. 936ff. If you don't have a Bible handy, specific passages can be looked up on [http://bible.oremus.org/](oremus Bible Browser). On Sundays one might wish to use lessons from the Eucharistic Lectionary instead, which can be conveniently found at [https://lectionarypage.net](lectionarypage.net).

One also may wish to find, again from [https://lectionarypage.net](lectionarypage.net), the collect for this Sunday to use as the first of the collects (after the Lord's Prayer).
