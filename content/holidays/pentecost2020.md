> Almighty God, on this day you opened the way of eternal life to every race and nation by the promised gift of your Holy Spirit: Shed abroad this gift throughout the world by the preaching of the Gospel, that it may reach to the ends of the earth; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen.**


## We Hear God’s Word
**The First Lesson**	--- _Numbers 11:24-30_
Lector:
> A reading from the book of Numbers.
>>
>> Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord; and he gathered seventy elders of the people, and placed them all around the tent. Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do so again.
>>
>> Two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp. And a young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp." And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, "My lord Moses, stop them!" But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit on them!" And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
>>
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**Psalm 104:25-35, 37** --- _Benedic, anima mea_ --- _(BCP	736)_

> 25 O Lord, how manifold are your works! *
> in wisdom you have made them all;
> the earth is full of your creatures.
> 26 **Yonder is the great and wide sea
> with its living things too many to number, *
> creatures both small and great.**
>
> 27 There move the ships,
> and there is that Leviathan, *
> which you have made for the sport of it.
> 28 **All of them look to you *
> to give them their food in due season.**
>
> 29 You give it to them; they gather it; *
> you open your hand, and they are filled with good things.
> 30 **You hide your face, and they are terrified; *
> you take away their breath,
> and they die and return to their dust.**
>
> 31 You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; *
> and so you renew the face of the earth.
> 32 **May the glory of the Lord endure for ever; *
> may the Lord rejoice in all his works.**
>
> 33 He looks at the earth and it trembles; *
> he touches the mountains and they smoke.
> 34 **I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; *
> I will praise my God while I have my being.**
>
> 35 May these words of mine please him; *
> I will rejoice in the Lord.
> 37 **Bless the Lord, O my soul. *
> Hallelujah!**


**The Second Lesson** --- _Acts 2:1-21_

Lector:
> A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.
##### The introduction to this passage (Acts 2:1--4) is read in various languages.
>
>> When the day of Pentecost had come, the disciples were all together in one place. And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.
>>
>> Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs-- in our own languages we hear them speaking about God's deeds of power." All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" But others sneered and said, "They are filled with new wine."
>>
>> But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning. No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
>>
>> 'In the last days it will be, God declares,
>> that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
>> and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
>> and your young men shall see visions,
>> and your old men shall dream dreams.
>>
>> Even upon my slaves, both men and women,
>> in those days I will pour out my Spirit;
>> and they shall prophesy.
>>
>> And I will show portents in the heaven above
>> and signs on the earth below,
>> blood, and fire, and smoky mist.
>>
>> The sun shall be turned to darkness
>> and the moon to blood,
>> before the coming of the Lord's great and glorious day.'
>
> The word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

**The Holy Gospel** --- _John 7:37-39_
Deacon:
> The Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to John.

**People:**
> **Glory to you, Lord Christ.**

Deacon:
>> When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”
>

Deacon:
> The Gospel of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Praise to you, Lord Christ.**
