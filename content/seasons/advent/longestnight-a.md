### About the Longest Night
The **winter solstice** happens around 21 December every year. This is the longest night of the year, before the nights start getting shorter and the days longer. The Advent and Christmas seasons can feel like long, dark nights for those who find themselves out of step with the persistent and often artificial “cheer” of the season that assaults us from every side. The backdrop of traditions and cheeriness can remind us of our own losses and sadness. The added stresses of the continuing pandemic, politics, unrest, and visible injustice add to our weight of sadness.

The **Nativity of our Lord** was a time for rejoicing, but it also involved much fear, sadness, anxiety, and terror. The Incarnation of our Lord meant that God in the flesh would experience the full range of human emotions, joining us in our mourning as well as in our joy.

The **Longest Night Mass** is intended to bring balance to our Advent and Christmas observances, making space for those emotions which don’t fit into the advertisers’ profit motive, but are very much a part of our lives. Sadness, emptiness, and even depression are valid, important emotions for Christians. They are God-given and correspond to the very real challenges and brokenness in our lives. You are welcome here.

St. Thomas’ mission and ministry is completely funded by its members and guests. If you would like to contribute to the work we do, you can find an offering basin behind the last pew before the offertory, or you can [give online](https://donate.stthomasglassboro.org).

Remember those whom we now name, silently or aloud: all who have died in the peace of Christ, and those whose faith is known to you alone; bring them into the place of eternal joy and light.

_The people are invited to call aloud names they wish to add to the prayer._

Remember those whom we now name, silently or aloud: those who yet live, from whom we are separated in body or in heart; bring us into a reconciliation or renewal of those relationships which are precious to us.

_The people are invited to call aloud names they wish to add to the prayer._
