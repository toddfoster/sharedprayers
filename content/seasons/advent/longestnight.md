### About the Longest Night
The **winter solstice** happens around 21 December every year. This is the longest night of the year, before the nights start getting shorter and the days longer. The Advent and Christmas seasons can feel like long, dark nights for those who find themselves out of step with the persistent and often artificial “cheer” of the season that assaults us from every side. The backdrop of traditions and cheeriness can remind us of our own losses and sadness. The added stresses of the continuing pandemic, politics, unrest, and visible injustice have added to our weight of sadness in 2021. The absence of the sun during this time of year doesn’t help either!

The **Nativity of our Lord** was a time for rejoicing, but it also involved much fear, sadness, anxiety, and terror. The Incarnation of our Lord meant that God in the flesh would experience the full range of human emotions, joining us in our mourning as well as in our joy.

The **Longest Night Mass** is intended to bring balance to our Advent and Christmas observances, making space for those emotions which don’t fit into the advertisers’ profit motive, but are very much a part of our lives. Sadness, emptiness, and even depression are valid, important emotions for Christians. They are God-given and correspond to the very real challenges and brokenness in our lives. You are welcome here.

> O God of peace, who has taught us that in returning and rest we shall be saved, in quietness and confidence shall be our strength: By the might of your Spirit lift us, we pray you, to your presence, where we may be still and know that you are God; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  **Amen.**

## We Hear God’s Word
{{% lesson "first" "Isaiah 40:1-8, 27-31" %}}
Comfort, O comfort my people,
   says your God.
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
   and cry to her
that she has served her term,
   that her penalty is paid,
that she has received from the Lord’s hand
   double for all her sins.
A voice cries out:
‘In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord,
   make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be lifted up,
   and every mountain and hill be made low;
the uneven ground shall become level,
   and the rough places a plain.
Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
   and all people shall see it together,
   for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.’

A voice says, ‘Cry out!’
   And I said, ‘What shall I cry?’
All people are grass,
   their constancy is like the flower of the field.
The grass withers, the flower fades,
   when the breath of the Lord blows upon it;
   surely the people are grass.
The grass withers, the flower fades;
   but the word of our God will stand for ever.

Why do you say, O Jacob,
   and speak, O Israel,
‘My way is hidden from the Lord,
   and my right is disregarded by my God’?
Have you not known? Have you not heard?
The Lord is the everlasting God,
   the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He does not faint or grow weary;
   his understanding is unsearchable.
He gives power to the faint,
   and strengthens the powerless.
Even youths will faint and be weary,
   and the young will fall exhausted;
but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength,
   they shall mount up with wings like eagles,
they shall run and not be weary,
   they shall walk and not faint.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth.

Remember those whom we now name, silently or aloud: those who yet live, from whom we are separated in body or in heart; bring us into a reconciliation or renewal of those relationships which are precious to us.
